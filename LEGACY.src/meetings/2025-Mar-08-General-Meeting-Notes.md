# Notes

## == Kudos and Recognition ==
Wh4l3 for new artwork, Patrigan for patrigan, Divides By Zero for work on skill leveling, Robotmonkey for work on abilities branch. 

## == Summary and decisions ==
Tiebreaker poll for name - Wanderers of the Rift won! We will start using the new name. 

New channel called community polls - used for polls to community, 1st poll is durability poll to decide if we are keeping durability. 

Enchanting - do we want Vanilla like enchanting in the game and to what extent. Check out discussion in the forums. Probably going to have poll on enchanting poll next week. 

## == MVP Updates ==
We really need rooms! We only have two rooms and one POI. 

Builds are really important so we can have interesting rifts. We are wanting to aim for even more than VH.

Don't be afraid to throw something down even if you don't consider yourself good at building. 

Decision Process - Discussion in voice or chat -> Idea polishing in Forums -> Polling for options (more than 2) -> Guidelines / Results published on mdBook once decision is taken -> Changes/Actions timelines depending on decisions. 

Also reference guide in mdBook:  https://dimension-delvers.github.io/dimension-delvers-docs/polls/polls.html 

We wont have a playtesting team, everyone is the playtesting team

## == Deemos ==

Skill gem demo from Divides By Zero - Different gems would be upgradable with different number/tier of options. Skill trees are randomly generated per gem, so two base gems are not necessarily going to end up being the same. 

Ability demo from Patrigan created by RobotMonkey - ability that summons skeletons and then they explode and die when they hit the ground. Cooldown indicator top left. Summoning of skeletons is completely configured using datapacks. We have alot of flexibility and depth that can be done using the current system.  Ball Ball ability which has bouncy balls. Think of making abilities that work well together. 

## == Next meeting ==

Next Week, March 15.
Due to dailylight savings, check Event in Discord for precise time.
