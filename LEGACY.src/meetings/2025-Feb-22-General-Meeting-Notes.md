# Notes

Date: February 22 2025 Time: 8PM UTC

## == Summary and decisions ==
* A LOT of movements towards MVP in Rune Anvil/Socket, Rift Generation, Modifier System, Inventory Snapshots, Accessibility Configs, Builder Glasses, Rift Entry Portal, 3Dd Rift Mapper, First Chest Variant, Dev Tools. 
* Devs please delete branches that have been merged in. 
* Rift mapper is running and will be 3d because rift will have height as well.
* Durability is removed from everything because durability is lame. 
* Accessibility setting added for different things that can be adjusted. 
* Rift entrance visual has been created.

## == Game Design == 
Rifts: 
Rift key - determining what this is/ how the player will create is really important for making progress in MVP
Rift entrance, themes, tiered rift levels, spawners, RiftMapper are also things to discuss. 

Progression: 
Skill trees - do we want or no? How do we wanna do them? What is a skill tree?
Gear Progression - How do we progress gear? Just modifiers or add more? 
Gear base - how to make weapon/armor more unique?
Skill Mechanic - What type of skills will we have
Build-A-Spell - How do we want to do spells and have them easily expandable. 
Abilities - 
Endgame - what do we want to do for endgame? What should the player be working for? Please go discuss.

Other: 
Durability - Gone
Unique Biomes - should this be in Overworld? What rift related things do we want to have in overworld?
Damage Types - how would we want to implement this? What type of damage types would we want?
Eras of Progression - Barry Summary: 5 eras, Era of Exploration keeps it pretty basic and goal is to introduce the player to the core mechanics of the modpack that are different from vanilla minecraft, Era of Expansion we start to add onto the core concepts bringing in some of the more complex aspects such as potentially modifying rifts/gear, skills open up alot more etc., Era of Stabilization/Experimentation Player has a decent grasp on what the pack adds and maybe has a build/playstyle they are actively working towards, or are experimenting with alot of playstyles and builds, Era of Perfection all tools are available to the player, probably the most grindy era focus is on perfecting the build and entering endgame content, Era of Conclusion the player is fully into the endgame and maybe big final boss fight, not all players necessarily make it here and thats ok. For more info see link in links section.
