> ## [Guild Concepts]()

### **The Circle**
- Witch-themed ability guild focused on team-based magic, where powers are enhanced when used in groups.
- Craft potions using magic instead of heat, making potion-making central to their gameplay and distinct from vanilla.
- The guild explores underdeveloped witch lore and is tied to the essence of "union" / "order".

> ## [Essence – Alternative Concept]()

_Reply to Post 'Essence Force Chart'_

- New, more general essence names leaving specifics undefined and open to interpretation.
- NOT fire/water/earth/air.
- 7 foundational essences can combine and react with others to make new essences.
- Possible integration with abilities as **ability modifiers**.
