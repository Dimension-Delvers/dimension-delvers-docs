## [Essence Creation Guild](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1388685966818148403/1388685966818148403)
- Warren is now leading this guild. Ownership will be updated when CJ adjusts permissions.
- Warren proposed three conceptual directions for the guild:
    1. Tied to the Sages.
    2. As a craftsman family.
    3. As a science-focused guild.
- Discussion included that tying this guild to the creation of the Hub world explains why there aren't more hub worlds or why rifts can’t be stabilized due to lost knowledge.
- Suggestion that the guild is trying to regain lost understanding after the founders (who were knowledgeable but poor teachers) passed.
- Suggestion that they still have the knowledge but due to the increasing instability it is no longer applicable

## [Material](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1387618332756410498/1387618332756410498)
- Galactic is creating lore around materials both mundane and magical.
    - Example: palette blocks, like the newly named “ethereal brass,” an alloy of gold and copper.
- Looking for pitches on three or four vanilla blocks with multiple “versions” of why they exist, as a test run.

## [Ability Creation Guild](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1386024438151249971/1386024438151249971)
- Key questions raised:
    - Is the guild about discovering abilities, improving them, or both?
    - Should it be one guild with subgroups, or multiple guilds?
- Points included:
    - The guild should focus on abilities as a mechanic/concept, not solely on individual abilities.
    - Sub-guilds or class factions could handle specific skill types.
    - Players could unlock additional ability slots or reduce skill thread costs via reputation.
- QoL:
    - Single space to see all available abilities
    - Tooltips to explain and provide guidance on how to discover/unlock unavailable abilities
    - Not RNG drops
 

#### Class System & Guild Structure
- Two systems under consideration:
    - Classless (players pick any ability).
    - Class-tied guilds (specific abilities linked to guilds but pick and choose, more of archetypes).
- Discussed an “adventurer’s hall” or umbrella guild where all abilities are visible in one place, requiring progression with other guilds to unlock them.
- Proposed “wanderer school” to offer basic abilities, with guilds contributing specialized courses once players reach certain milestones.

#### Ability Acquisition
- Consensus against heavy RNG (random drops) for abilities.
- Preference is for most abilities to be craftable, with some special ones earned via quests or rewards.

## [Sages](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1385701753533759559/1385701753533759559)
- The Sages topic is intertwined with the Essence discussion.
- Sages:
    - Seen as founders of the Hub, originally mortals who (may have) transcended mortality through Essence manipulation.
    - Each held mastery over a specific Essence type.
    - Act as advisors or guides, possibly tied to different profession guilds but still distinct.

##  [Hub World](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1385778207298420827/1385778207298420827)
- Hub world discussed as:
    - A safe haven or refugee retreat, possibly newer rather than ancient.
    - Could change in single vs multiplayer—single player might offer a plot to build on, unlike the locked Hub in multiplayer.
    - Suggested to explore if it’s post-apocalyptic or not and add a question about the Hub’s age to the discussion thread.

## [Shrines](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1386378785770700860/1386378785770700860)
- Current concept has Shrines renamed to Anomalies.
- Will have multiple types, with energy releases when shut down.
- Could represent failed objectives by players or NPCs.
- Rachael to edit prompt to better broaden what shrines are/can be.
