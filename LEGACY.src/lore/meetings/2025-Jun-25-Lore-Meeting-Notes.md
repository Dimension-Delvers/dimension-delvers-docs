Notes from 25/06/2025 Lore Meeting

[Ability Creation Guild](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1386024438151249971)
Do we want a Poll on if the ability creation guild is about making abilities, improving them or both? Is this One guild, One with subgroups, multiple guilds? Yes

Guild factions within guilds, like food guild, with pie and strudel factions within food guild. Strudel big single buff and pies people pies are better, they give 2 buffs at 50%.

Note on accessibility – guild icons and quick notes on guilds are wanted  
before flowery/long text (in guild?). Map as well for any sort of hub world implemented

Reseller guild, buys things for 30% under cost  
selling to right guild 25% under cost (selling armor to an armorer guild)  
Selling under cost 50% to wrong guild

Discussion on what guilds are/ what they cover is 100% wanted. [Guild Pitch Requirements](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1387825112509710607)

Lots of talk about guilds, mostly we don't know. Need more info.   
What guilds would be interesting.

Vote on hub world wanted.

Guilds at spawn for 1.02 guild update? Where should they exist at this stage?

Different species in hub and for players (species benefits/traits a player can choose from)? Start discussion?

Changing shines name to Anomaly's   
if there are different yet unnamed types.

Lore that was agreed in chat and needs to be looked at and OKed by others   
\- there is energy released when closing the anomaly's

* this energy cause the effect then closed  
  \- when closing items / mobs can fall out of the hole if the size is right.
* Talk about using fabric terms
* anomalies are another reality trying to form a gateway to your reality by stitching itself to yours
* to close the anomaly you have to cut the threads holding them together
* In closing the anomaly (cutting the threads) the treads – effects, the thread turns to dust and covers the player, the threads unravel into a miss and dissipate into the room (rift/room effects?), the threads are sucked back into the anomaly knocking out an item (don't know if the last effect was in the meeting or an after note?)

  Anomalies lore talked about but needs more discussion

* Anomalies need to be shut on both sides?
* Anomalies are made from unfinished rifts?
