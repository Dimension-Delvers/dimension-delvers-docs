The Hub is **an elegant collection of interconnected platforms and spires** 

Floating in empty space that serves as a neutral meeting ground between dimensions. The architecture is a deliberate fusion of the finest design principles from multiple realities:

A location that provides optimal access to the greatest variety of dimensions with the least dimensional turbulence. It's the prime real estate that sophisticated entities compete to access.

The surrounding space isn't empty void but rather a carefully maintained neutral zone where different physical laws can coexist without interference. The "sky" here shows carefully curated views of various realities, serving both as navigation aids and as an ever-changing gallery of cosmic beauty.
