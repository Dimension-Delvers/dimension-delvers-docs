> ## [Ability Guilds](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1386024438151249971/1386024438151249971)

The team revisited ability guilds, aiming to rework past ideas with updated direction.

- **Not class-based**: Guilds should craft, enhance, or modify abilities. Not unlock them.
- **Thematic Separation**: Splitting ability by concepts, feel, or archetype.
- **Guild consolidation**: Barry suggested a unified guild model with sub-factions (merchant district style).
- **Past proposals**: Warren will compile old guild ideas for potential repurposing.
##
- Possible reuse of color/lore themes from previous suggestions even if not voted in.
- “Threadwright” guild was revisited as a potential fit.
- "Tower" & "Lodge" used as example for identity & vibe.

> ## [Rift Shrines](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1386378785770700860/1386378785770700860)
Terminology suggestions: “Shrines” / "Rift Tears" / "Altars"  

### Questions
- Are Rift Tears uniform?
- Do they affect the world or generate emotion?
- What do they look like (size, shape, variety)?

### Concepts
- **Golden / Cursed / Sage-Touched** shrine variants.
- “Infected Rift” origin story – caused by prankster Sage.
- **Player feedback**: Visual and audio responses upon interaction.
- SFX/VFX:
    - _Good_: sparkles + “boom”
    - _Bad_: particles + “womp-womp”

### Similar to
- VH-style pylons.
- Beacon/brazier-style objectives.
- VH god altars

> ## [Sages](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1385701753533759559/1385701753533759559)

The term **“Sage”** is under review due to baggage from older versions.

### Possible Replacements
- “The Council”
- “Masked Cloaked Figures” (Court of Owls-style)
- Role passed down via objects or traditions

### Possible Reframes
- Sages built the **Hub’s central Rift structure** (refined bedrock disc, pillars, anchor).
- Created the **`Essence Guild**, teaching new wanderers rift mechanics.
- Founding or highly skilled wanderer's selected and appointed role.

>## [Hub World](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1385778207298420827/1385778207298420827)

Hub world lore decisions can impact:
- Sage
- Essence
- Guilds

Matt is developing a **fresh hub concept**, detached from earlier versions.

Suggesting to look at hubworld from a lore only focus. What goes on n the day-to-day life of it's inhabitents.
Not just the player's perspective.

>## [Guild Types](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1386414856886030446/1386414856886030446)

New thread to be posted in game dev establishing desired guild purposes/function.

>## Campaign System

Campaigns are modular, opt-in lore arcs. They should:
- Teach through play (environment/NPCs)
- Avoid altering the global world state
- Be story-driven, not mechanically required

[Thread](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1386023937057620080/1386023937057620080) already posted in lore to discuss structure and what campaigns should include from lore aspect.

[New thread](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1386424463163129976/1386424463163129976) to be posted in game dev to establish mechanics and implementation.

>## Lore preservation

Unused ideas may live on as collectible book content—a way to preserve cut lore.

“Cool but unused” features could be shown off in-game, rewarding curiosity.


---

>## New Forum Categories
### Tasks vs Topics
- **Tasks**: Have owners, specific outputs
- **Topics**: Open brainstorms, could lead to task creation or be created to explore tasks
