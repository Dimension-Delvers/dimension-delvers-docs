# Workshop #5 – Tutorial & Quests (Meeting Notes – June 1, 2025)

> _Tutorial design, Greeble onboarding, Wild Rifts, Guild functions, Lore tracks, and Progression systems_

---

> ## Tutorial Design

There’s a strong push to build a tutorial experience that sets tone, teaches core systems, and integrates smoothly into broader gameplay without hand-holding or overwhelming players.

### Starting Options
Various proposals on where players begin:
- In a rift, immediately immersed in gameplay.
- In the Overworld, then triggered into a rift (e.g., after chopping a tree).
- In a Hub World, introduced to rift mechanics through a guided quest.

- Concerns raised that forcing players into a rift early might feel abrupt or “jarring.”
- A compass to locate rifts or an early Greeble encounter could offer a softer on-ramp.

---

> ## Greeble as Onboarding NPC

Inspired by Skyrim’s Hadvar/Ralof opening, the Greeble could act as a quirky but functional guide.

- Demonstrates rune gem bartering (eats a gem and gives new gem).
- Walks player through the first rift loop: enter > loot POIs > exit.
- Introduces danger subtly (“something watching”).
- May initiate a combat encounter where the player has to rescue the Greeble.

---

> ## Key Tutorial Elements

- Teach through action, not exposition. Avoid overly scripted or hand-holdy content.
- Encourage exploration and self-directed learning by not locking players in.

Example flow:
- Greeble eats a gem → bartering intro.
- Player explores POIs → looting.
- Greeble gets in trouble → combat.

---

> ## Tutorial Delivery Methods

Quest books, NPC dialogue, or a starter “note” in inventory.

### Possible formats:
- Controlled tutorial rift with light combat and loot.
- Player receives a tutorial Rift Key that opens a unique, instanced space.
- Unkillable player status during tutorial to reduce frustration.
- Supports different world types (skyblock, oceanblock, stoneblock, etc.).

---

> ## Rifts

Gameplay loop is built around entering rifts, collecting loot, and expanding progression via guilds and gear.

### Wild Rift Concept
Rifts can vary by dimension:
- Overworld Rifts: Tame, resource-rich, introductory.
- Nether Rifts: Combat-heavy, ideal for learning abilities.
- End Rifts: High-stakes objectives, late-game.

- Should evolve in complexity across the game.

---

> ## Tutorial vs. Wild Rifts

Early progression can be gated behind:
- Wild Rift discovery.
- Greeble-led quests.
- Summonable rifts via Rift Keys or Spawners.

Suggested mechanic: _“Wild Rift Sickness”_ debuff to prevent abuse or speedrunning.

---

> ## Multiplayer Considerations

Potential issues:
- Everyone rushing to one wild rift.
- Server strain from permanent rift zones.

Possible solutions:
- Instanced rifts or timer-based rift resets.
- Perpetual Rift at spawn with limited use.
- Group-compatible tutorial rifts.

---

> ## Guild System

Function, structure, and role in tutorials.

How can guilds anchor both mechanics and narrative? Rather than being generic quest hubs, guilds could be specialized, theme-driven systems that support gameplay progression and world-building.

### Function & Specialization
Guilds could focus on specific mechanics:
- Rune Gems & Socketing
- Rift Creation & Traversal
- Combat & Abilities
- Crafting/Tech
- Fishing/Cooking (profession-style)

Instead of one-size-fits-all, guilds could act as mini-mod unlockers or profession tracks.

---

> ## Greebles and Their Role

- Greebles are not seen as the "Rift guild".
- Their current primary focus is rune gems and gem upgrading.
- They may assist with Rift tutorials but aren’t responsible for all rift knowledge.
- Suggestion: a different “wise old” character introduces rift keys.

---

> ## Guild Progression & Talent Trees

- Reputation-based unlocks: more you interact with a guild, the more features you gain.
- Possibility of each guild having a custom talent tree aligned with its theme.
- Goal is for players to build their own gameplay paths rather than being pushed into a single meta.
- Clear functional separation helps players know where to go for what.

---

> ## Lore & Storytelling

Optional but deep.

### Worldbuilding Concepts
- A foundational base framework can be designed for consistency and shared language.
- Lore explains the origin of rift tech, guilds, rune gems, etc.
- Introduction of a “Ratty Journal” to start the tutorial with hints of deeper lore.

---

> ## Campaigns: Optional Narrative Tracks

Proposed mechanic: standalone, story-driven campaigns players can opt into.

Inspired by D&D-style modules—self-contained arcs with progression and rewards.

Examples:
- “Rift for Dummies” campaign as the tutorial.
- Campaigns tied to specific guilds or cross-guild conflicts.
- Replayable stories with different outcomes and reputation boosts.

---

> ## Implementation Goals

- Avoid locking core mechanics behind campaigns.

Campaigns offer:
- XP
- Guild rep
- Cosmetics or non-essential rewards

Emphasis is on player choice: skip if you want, but they’re there if you enjoy story.

---

> ## Hub World

Growing sentiment that the Hub World is the backbone for tutorial delivery, rift access, and guild discovery.

### Options on first login:
- Jump right into the tutorial rift.
- Gather some gear, then enter.
- Ignore and explore freely.

- Tutorial rift could be small and pre-generated to avoid performance issues and support multiplayer.

---

> ## Hub vs Overworld

- The Overworld’s relevance is under question.
- Can the game be played entirely from the Hub?
- Should the Overworld be resource-focused only?

- Minimize reliance on overworld generation, especially for skyblock/oceanblock compatibility.

---

> ## Progression Systems

How players progress and how tightly mods and mechanics should be gated.

### Mod Unlock Philosophy

Two player styles:
- Explorers who enjoy unlocking things slowly.
- Builders who want tools accessible early.

- Concerns about locking essential QOL mods (digital storage) behind heavy grind or rep requirements.
- Can make the early game feel frustrating, especially in multiplayer.

### Ideas for compromise:
- Offer mod unlocks via currency from rifts/quests.
- Gate power tools but not quality-of-life items.
- Difficulty settings could let players choose how gated their playthrough is.

---

> ## Purpose-Driven Design

- Importance of designing intentional gameplay loops to support each mod, not just include them for variety.
- Why include Create (and similar mods) if nothing needs to be automated?
- Currently, materials are too easy to get.

Suggestion: Use quests or rift-earned currency to buy mod components.

---

> ## Housing & Early Game Comfort

Reduce early-game friction, brainstormed options for providing shelter and storage up front.

- Premade Housing / Tent System
- Allows players to jump into exploration or rift-running without needing to build a base.

---

> ## Quality of Life & Server Settings

Multiplayer and performance considerations should play a big role in shaping the pack’s structure.

### Performance Optimization

- Concerns over large Hub Worlds straining performance, especially for lower-end players.

Solutions discussed:
- Let players adjust NPC density for performance.
- Use guild workstations or terminals instead of physical NPCs.
- Allow remote guild access from bases (e.g., mailbox, phone, hologram).

### Server Config Options

Not all players will want to play the same way:
- Some want full mod access from the start.
- Others prefer a grind-to-earn structure.

Suggested solution: server toggle for gating systems.
- Servers could choose how strict or loose progression should be.
- Important to balance this so both playstyles can coexist peacefully.

---

> ## Next Steps & Ongoing Work

The team wants to move from ideation into action by clearly defining systems and putting proposals to a vote.

### Polls & Decision-Making

- Concerns raised over past polls being too vague or inconclusive.

### Action Items:
- @WarrenGore will draft a refined Hub World post to clarify its design options.
- Follow-up polls will break down big topics (like Hub World form, tutorial intro method, guild function) into smaller decisions.
- Wednesday’s meeting will focus on tutorial design and expanding on guild/tutorial synergy.
