# Decorative & Building Block Mods
## Which mods should we add to increase themes?
To make beautiful themes, we need some more blocks than vanilla offers. First of all, those mods need to be not ARR (licensed). This is so that when the mod gets discontinued, we can take the code and continue it ourselves, making it future proof and not a liability. There is a forum post that contains a list of mods, which has been distilled to no-ARR and 1.21.4.
All mods will NOT affect gameplay/worldgen. The first 6 by default, the last by changing config (which will be done).
