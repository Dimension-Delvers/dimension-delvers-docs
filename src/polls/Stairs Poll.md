# Stairs Poll
Poll for the builders section
## How do we want pathway elevation to be?

To get a general consensus on how traveling our rooms should be, please vote in the following poll.
This only applies to the Path Processor Blocks, not floor or any other.

Should elevation changes between levels in a room be smooth enough for players to walk or run up and down seamlessly, or is it acceptable for some transitions to require jumping?

Please vote, and discuss here!
