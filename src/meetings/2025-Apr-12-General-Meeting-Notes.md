## == Kudos and Recognition ==
Docs team and Cjzech for work on summaries 

## == Summary and decisions ==
We are needing example pitches from some already brainstormed areas such as (abilities, rune gems, rift key creation, hub world, etc.)

Polls: 
Monetary Involvement poll closed with Cost recovery + warchest + charity overflow winning at 76%
Lore coordinator poll starting this week between Cjzech and xD0R0x.
Potentially adding a new art coordinator position.

## == MVP Updates ==
Cleanup phase and working on getting everything working together. Abilities are stable and ready, dimension gen is getting polished, and modifiers are now in place. Trying to avoid having too many bugs, and the MVP is in a state where it feels easy to use for anyone. 

### == Build Updates ==
Build event coming up on Monday and Wednesday. 
Tutorial is complete in mdBooks
Always good to have more rooms so please keep adding rooms
New processor blocks added
Mod update allows people to work offline

### == Demos ==
None for the week!

### == Brainstorming Updates ==
Hub world discussions: intermediary between rifts and overworld where player can interact with NPC groups
Guild/Faction Discussion: Guilds friendly, Factions hostile, player can progress with any/all groups. 

Value Detail Discussion: More feedback please.
