### == Summary and decisions ==
Release 0.1.0 today!!!
Including: 
Basic rifting with some form of scaling (we will need to balance this still but something exists)
2 Themes currently, more coming soonTM
Build team killed it and repetition of rooms/pois is reduced a lot but will go down even more as more themes are added.
Basic objectives currently we only have kill mobs. 
Rift Key generation using essences
Sockets and runegems are available on vanilla gear
Vanilla gear supports implicit modifiers
3 Abilities in game currently: Fireball, Dash, Heal
Loot is in game

There will be files released for Curseforge/Modrinth.

Considerations: 
No balance testing done yet, minimal bug testing done, focus on functionality, no riftmapper (Yet), GeckoLib required, Low performance during rift gen currently. 

### == Testing ==
Areas to focus on while testing: 
Is it fun?
What is missing?
Are there bugs?

GitHub Bug Logging - this is the place to log bugs/feedback

Testing team (coming maybe in future)

### == Build Updates ==
Lots of rooms added
Review can be done in review channel under the build category

### == Art Updates ==
Art waiting for lore to get built to move forward.
Art guidelines will be built from that, and then actual art will come from those guidelines. 

Current things to do: Update current assets! Make things for the main theme/branding.

Some general guidelines are added but are still being updated. 

### == Brainstorming Updates ==
Brainstormings will be focused on things that are currently in MVP, things that are needed. 

Lore brainstorms we want to focus on (anyone can add here): 
Story ideas - goal to have something by next week
