### == Brainstorming Updates ==
Chainminer brainstorm paused pending clarity on how chests are broken. 

Lore: 
Planning on getting some polls out today about story ideas, greebls, etc.
There are currently roughly 9 story ideas to work through and centralize

Focuses for the next week are: Factions and Guilds, Discovering lore, Quest Lore, and Essence force.
Try to keep to story and not gameplay mechanics since gameplay mechanics are limiting where story is more free. 

### == Demos ==
Riftfaster added for MUCH faster rift generation. 

Rune anvil, needs runegems to work with. Runegem geodes can be raw or framed and come from any chest in rift, Framed are found more commonly in higher tier rifts. Right click to open geode and it will give you a Runegem (tags show where it is socketable). Not all runegems are applicable to all slots, for example jump height is only on legs and boots. The runegems have more variety in modifiers in framed versions. 

Gear has implicits example: iron helmet gives attack damage. When applying runegems in rune anvil shapes will need to match what is rolled on gear, left side will show current version of the item, and right will show updated version after runegems are applied. 

Monster runegem geodes have unique shape currently this may change later. 

Rune gems can be overwritten to “reroll” the modifier which is applied.
