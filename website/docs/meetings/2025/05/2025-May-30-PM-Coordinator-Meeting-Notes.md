# **WotR PM & Coordinator Meeting Summary**

---

## **Community-Driven Decision Making**

### **Pitch to Feature Process Rework**

* The current “Pitch to Feature” process is not working as intended.
    * Was meant to open after MVP release but is sitting in limbo
* We're exploring the creation of a new discord layout to support the intended flow of the process.

* Any revisions will be shared for community input and approval before implementation.

* Documentation of example flow to show how process is intended to work

### **Poll Strategy Improvements**

* All future feature polls will include a Docs Team summary to provide context and clarity.

* Poll durations will be tailored to topic complexity (quick turnaround feedback vs. long term strategic decisions).

### **Future Roadmapping & Prioritization**

* Considering a priority system to help the community signal which ideas should be worked on next.

* A rotating idea thread may be introduced to highlight actively discussed concepts.

* A high-level public roadmap to increase transparency into what’s coming next.
    * Roadmap informed by priority system above

### **Contributor Participation**

* The Contributor Ideas forum was moved to improve project organization.

* Although it is contributor visible only, the project has minimal entry barriers, so we continue to value broad community participation.

## **Urgency & Lore Alignment**

* Development began with high energy, and lore emphasis came slightly later.

* The team is aligned on the importance of building a foundational lore structure to keep pace with ongoing development.

* Many contributors come from projects with little to no lore, so there is genuine excitement to create something rich and intentional.

## **Lore Team Direction**

* General guiding principle moving forward:

  | “Don’t talk about gameplay in lore.”

    * This isn’t a hard rule, but a reminder that specific gameplay mechanics like exact percentages, stats, or balance implications should not be detailed in lore discussions. Lore can and should reference gameplay in broad strokes, but the exact implementation details are better left to cross team or systems wide conversations.

    * When the lore team wants to explore a concept that heavily involves gameplay design or mechanics, those conversations should be initiated in the contributor-ideas forum, where members from all relevant teams can contribute. This helps ensure alignment across lore, design, and development without restricting creativity.

## **Processes & Structure**

* We are working toward clear processes for:
    * How people join or move into all project roles (Contributor, Coordinator, PM, Director, etc.)
    * How decisions are made with community developed processes that go to a vote before implementation.

* Updated drafts of roles and responsibilities for PMs, Coordinators, and Directors will be published for community feedback and approval.

---

## **Transparency & Communication**

* PM and Coordinator meetings (like this one) will be summarized and shared regularly with the broader community.

    * Posted to mdBooks, in consideration how this would be communicated regularly
* We aim to keep all contributors informed and involved in key project discussions and updates.

---

## **Server Discussion**

* Ongoing conversation about moving WotR development to a dedicated Discord server.
    * This would help clarify project identity while still maintaining ties to the Wolds community.
    * If pursued, the move would be announced well in advance, with a transition period and checks to ensure all team members are moved successfully.
