Mod Development - Led by @iwolfking and @Xverion
Community/Topic Coordination
* 2 coordinators per topic
* Current topics are:
    * Dev (Manages the dev related chats and forums)
    * Community (Covers basic community moderation and makes sure the discord is managed as a whole)
    * Art (Covers art chat and related forums)
    * Build (Covers build chat and related forums)
    * Lore (Covers lore chat and related forums)
* New forums to show interest will be opened for each topic, send a message describing your interest
    * Interest must be noted prior to 11:59pm on Friday UTC as the project team will send out polls with the interested parties to let the community decide who will be coordinators

Development Flow:
Fork the repo - > Make changes on local repo -> Make a merge request -> Reviewers approve/deny request -> Approved changes get merged into repo

Reviewers
* Reviewers will still need to be picked
* Currently just @Xverion and @iwolfking
* Addon developers could be good options
* Limit usage of NBT data (Don't go overboard) -Xverion

Any developers that have interest in loot and ability system they can start on that. While abilities are not necessary for MVP they are simple and can be a good start for developers. Make simple loot for the time being. We could use the vanilla loot tables.

New Forum for Feature Development
* These forums are only meant to be used for active development, not a place for general discussion.

Saturday - Another meeting to review forums and pick options for the polls
