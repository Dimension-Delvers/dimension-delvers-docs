## Anomalies Discussion
- Looking to add **larger anomalies (5x5)** to the pool, alongside standard 3x3.
- Discussed anomaly concepts:
    - Requires **mana feeding** to close (could spawn mobs while active).
    - Needs a **fabric-themed item** to close.
    - Intersecting dimensions that **disintegrate on interaction**.
- Suggested interpretation: anomalies = interactable blocks/entities that have an effect or require an action to close.
- Altars/shrines ideas:
    - Feed on rift energies.
    - Could require **placing a block as an offering**, triggering effects based on item value.
    - Makes interactions more than just clicking.
- Goal: narrow to **one anomaly for next update**, simplest option is a **right-click event** triggering something.
- Suggests starting small & adding more types later.
- Plan:
    - Vote on anomaly concept.
    - If accepted, move to lore, art, and dev.
    - No mock-up art needed before vote.
- Idea of **anomaly categories** (like “Fragment anomaly,” “Remnant anomaly”).
- Should be quick events (small altars, few mobs), **not main objectives** but add interactive variety.

## Guilds & Currency
- Working toward a **framework for guild pitches**, to keep proposals aligned on:
    - Guild’s purpose.
    - Activities.
    - Currency use.
- Noted: first three guilds (Gem, Essence, Ability) have reached code design. Only confirmed point: **guilds will be in the game**.
- Discussed currency:
    - Options:
        - Every guild has its own.
        - Currency grouped by guild type.
        - Unified currency.
        - Or no currencies at all.
    - Flexibility preferred: e.g. quests reward tokens, redeemable for guild-specific items.
- Touched on how **currency ties to core guilds**, especially Essence & Ability.
- Ideas for digital currency:
    - “Money pouch” locked to player.
    - Digital system avoids physical coins.
    - Easier for finding currency in rifts or trading.
- Trading ideas:
    - Player bank guild or Terraria-style currency GUI.
    - Guilds represent different **game mechanics** (e.g. trading guild for exchange).
    - Selling items yields different prices:
        - Right trader: 10% under market.
        - Trading guild: 20% under.
        - Random: 50% under.
    - Worry: might confuse players who expect simpler ARPG selling.
- “Finance man” NPC:
    - Automates selling from chest.
    - Could be an upgrade to avoid manual selling.
- Auction house concerns:
    - Managing multiplayer economy vs single-player.
    - Auction for rare/cosmetic sinks (armor models, paintings, statues, fountains).
    - Discussed taxes as a gold sink.
- Ideas for offline player trading:
    - NPC instantly resells sold items.
    - Single-player uses fake logs with randomized price ranges.
    - Random chance a computer “buys” from you.

## Hub World
- Pitch prep underway, feedback requested.
- Hub World = **shared server-wide stable rift**:
    - Hosts NPCs & guild members.
    - Standard story exposure (less RNG).
    - Shops, guilds, buildings for immersion.
    - Center space for multiplayer events.
- Progression tied to **guild reputation system**.
- Simplest initial plan:
    - Static, singular location (no upgrades yet).
    - Cross-server aspects **not priority right now**.
- Tutorial likely deferred for later.
- MVP aim: get it in players’ hands fast to drive feedback & next steps.

---

## MVP & Roadmap
- Big push to get MVPs live so players generate ideas organically.
- Roadmap to Living Backlog:
    - Tracks done, in-progress, pitched.
    - Links to discussions, GitHub tasks, feedback.
- Want each feature to have a pitch.
- Internal project structure under **Internal Projects** (Google Doc / Miro).
- Check if any additional guild system features needed.

## Ability Gachapon & Loot
- **Ability Gachapon**:
    - On old roadmap.
    - One take was: Like spell scrolls (D&D, Baldur’s Gate 3).
    - Gachapon = toy gambling style.
    - Gotcha Pon viewed as another anomaly type (random effect).
    - Might drop plushie on shoulder or give minor boost.
    - Suggest adding to anomaly list.
- Loot ideas:
    - Add skins to loot tables, like Twilight Forest or Immersive Engineering.
    - Skins in containers, can be applied to gear.
    - Single-use skins valuable for trade.

---

## Transmogs & Armor Systems
- Build on transmogs:
    - Randomized coloration (paint can shifts color values).
    - Themed rift colors as standard, super rare “glitched” versions.
    - Inspired by Terraria dyes.
- Armor dye system:
    - Modifying Minecraft trim system to add dyes.
    - Prominence has trims working on modded armor by using vanilla shapes.
    - Vault Hunters have separate layers, might need custom implementation.
    - If trim doesn’t fit, appears as floating pixels (separate layer).

---

## Museums & World Concepts
- Ideas for **non-endgame activities**:
    - PvP arena (feature already listed).
    - Museum for completionists:
        - Fills with items you’ve found.
        - Microbiomes or Rift themes, murals for lore.
        - Could be instanced per player/team.
        - Shows different exhibits to different players (helmet on pillar vs explanatory sign).
        - Possibly via resource pack tricks.
- Fun idea: PvP arena with **“emperor’s booth”** to drop creepers into the fight.

---

## Team & Internal Discussions
- Pushing social media to attract more devs (Reddit, YouTube, Discord).
- Considering targeted outreach on dev-heavy spaces (NeoForge Reddit, tutorial discords).

---

## Onboarding & Mentorship
- Improve onboarding by:
    - Clearer paths for new members.
    - Mentorship system (tie to roles, timezones, load).
    - Queue system distributes newcomers to mentors.
- Already have **Navigators**, but want more intentional pairing.
- Suggest pairing new people with personal intros (e.g. hand off to Warren).
- Close onboarding ticket once connection confirmed.

---

## Other Notes & Tasks
- Move content from Google Docs to Wotr-docs
- **Divine Essences**:
    - Inspired by Vault Hunters S1 artifact puzzle.
    - Collectible goals for players.
- Post updates on onboarding buddies.
- Complete living backlog doc.

---

✅ **Next Actions**
- Prep shrine anomaly pitch for vote.
- Continue living backlog documentation.
- Outreach for devs, artists, builders (no such thing as too many POIs).
- Develop clear mentorship pairings.
- Move documentation to WotR-Doc.
