# Code Home
Welcome to the Code Home Page. This is where you can find all the code related information for the Wanderers of the Rift Mod(Pack).

## Important Code Pages
- [Code Decisions](decisions/decisions.md): The entry point to general code decisions.
- [Design Implementation Pointers](design/design-implementation.md): When a design requires specific code pointers, they will be explained here.

## Code Locations
### Mod
The Mod code is located at the [dimension-delvers-mod GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Dimension-Delvers/dimension-delvers-mod.git).

The intent of the mod is to provide a primary framework for the modpack. In the long term, this should be standalone, but as we start out, we will focus on making the best mod for our own modpack.

### Pack
The Pack code is located at the [dimension-delvers-pack GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Dimension-Delvers/dimension-delvers-pack.git).

The pack will add additional things that around the mod to make it a full modpack.

## Project Board
Our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/Dimension-Delvers/projects/1/views/1), contains a running list of all our open tasks. Anyone can pick up any ticket on this board. The coordinators will follow up, to ensure everything goes smoothly. The labels indicate the kind of work to be done for a ticket. There are 3 types of tasks on it, Feature, PoC and Spike. 
* **Feature**: Something that is already decided or we have to do this either way. This task is primarily coding work, most details should be ironed out already. *Example: Rift Generation, Structure Generation, Modifier System (our better version of enchantments)*.
* **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: The implementation of one of the suggestions given by people. By creating a PoC, we will be able to test it out, to help deciding if we want to continue on it. PoCs still require a lot of conversation, so try to involve the team as much as possible before implementing things. *Example: Gear Sockets, AbilitY Crystals, Cost of dying*
* **Spike**: A spike is something we know we need, but we have not yet discussed how to do it, or maybe we have discussed it high level, but no clear path to implementation. Spikes can be very exploratory, sometimes even involving a mini PoC. Spikes generally should not be too long, just enough time to prove it might work. A lot of the work in a spike will be conversation, make sure to take control of any Spike topic you pick up, including summarizing any ongoing discord conversation on the topic (if not already done by a Coordinator). *Example: Multiblock Altar, Wireframe Minimap, fishing*
