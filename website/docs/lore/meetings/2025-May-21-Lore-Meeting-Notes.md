> ## Essence System

Essence is the base layer of magic and reality—think "magical atoms."

- Originally planned for magic only, it’s now being used for items, abilities, rune gems, and more.
- Comparisons made to Avatar, Doodle God, Element Classic, and Black Clover.
- Essence can be extracted from blocks / items from rifts.

### Essence Chart Breakdown
- Void is the origin of all essences.
- **Main ring**: light, fire, chaos, air, darkness, earth, order, and water.
- **Outer ring (still in flux)**: life, nether, plant, space, power, animal, end, death, crystal, metal, time.
- Essences combine to create new ones (e.g., fire + earth = lava).
- Basic essences = “threads”, combinations = “yarns” (fabric theme).

### Integrations
- Empty rune gems can be infused with essence.
- Potential synergy bonuses if players build around a few essences.
- Examples include a "lava Claymore" for crossover between tech and magic.
- Essences may be physical items—e.g., turning an iron sword into a fire blade.

> ## Greebles & Tutorial Role

Greebles are echo creatures made from leftover Rift essence—tiny critters that mimic what’s passed through.

- Act as the in-game tutorial introducing rune gems and rift mechanics.
- Players first meet a Greeble struggling to open a geode.
- After helping, it eats a gem and spits out a rune gem.
- Quests revolve around feeding geodes to Greebles and unlocking guild abilities.

---

> ## Greeble Guild Design

The Greeble Guild is a starter/tutorial guild centered on rune gems.

- Aesthetic leaning toward crystal caves or mineral buildup.
- Greebles are gaseous beings inside shells; may build homes resembling their shells.

### Progression Suggestions
- Feed smaller Greebles for random gems.
- Feed larger Greebles to rank up.
- Greebles grow smarter and hungrier the more rune gems they eat.

---

> ## Greeble Identity & Personality

- Mimic other guilds, often badly—this attracts wanderers to exploit them.
- Described as goofy, gang-like, possibly pretending to be dumb (but maybe not).
- Guild leader might be called "Big Boss" or "Big Brother."
- Names like “Greebles” could be accidental, mispronounced, or just colloquial.
- Guild name still TBD — ideas include “Gem Garners” and “The Great Hunger.”

---

> ## Greeble Quests & Progression

- Quests focused on geode collection and gem transformation.
- Rank progression tied to feeding rune gems to Greebles.
- Quests should align with guild themes.
- Repeatable quests and minimal complexity preferred for 0.2.0.
- Possibility of Greeble rescue quests/objectives inside Rifts (e.g., defend, escort, rescue).

---

> ## Hub World Ideas

- If chosen, each guild could get its own island.
- Improves performance and centralizes interactions.
- Hub world vote might determine focus for 0.3.0.

---

> ## Guild System Expansion

- Two more guilds to be developed next.
- Both should be fabric-themed.
- Both focused on unlocking player abilities.
- Ideas include “The Interwoven” and “The Tangled.”

### Concerns Raised
- Too many sources of abilities (not just guilds).
- Compliance with fabric theme.
- Overlap or competition among guilds.

---

> ## Next Session & Voting

- Develop the next two guilds: names, theme, quest style, abilities, etc.
- Minecraft integration options will be voted on (from no vanilla to full integration).
- Hub world vote will affect multiple systems.
- Suggestion for ranked-choice voting to reflect nuanced preferences.
- A new thread will be posted to gather ideas for the next meeting.
