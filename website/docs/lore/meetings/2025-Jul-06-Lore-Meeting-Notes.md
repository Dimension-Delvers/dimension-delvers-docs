## Ability Concepts
- Explored three primary frameworks for ability creation:
    - **Hall:** focused on personal growth, with sub-guilds branching into specific ability styles such as movement or teleportation
    - **Academy:** envisioned as a structured teaching environment
    - **Arena:** a gladiatorial arena where participants hone abilities by fighting monsters or each other

- Discussion on whether other groups like **Ladies of the Line**, **Felt**, and **Threadwrights** should be included as part of lore vote of this task.
  - Emphasis placed on ensuring those who designed the groups approve their inclusion before putting them up for voting

## Dimension Concept
- Introduced a new dimension concept to address early-game progression problems similar to those in Vault Hunters, where players feel underpowered.
- Designed as a non-instanced world like the Overworld or Nether, structured in **progressive rings**:
    - **Eclipse Grove:** A dense forest with towering ashwood trees, leaning toward a dark, twilight aesthetic. Could contain ruins throughout or be limited to this area.
    - **Withering Mire:** Swampy terrain with rocky outcroppings, possibly hinting at underground regions.
    - **Glacial Expanse:** An icy biome, described as a “freezing hellscape,” with ideas for a deep frost underground layer and potential freezing mechanics.

- Intended to serve as a tutorial/resource/mining area where players can explore and prepare for Rifts.

### Balancing & Resetting
- To prevent overshadowing actual Rift gameplay:
    - Possible limitations on item levels or quality in this dimension.
    - Periodic resets, either on a timer (like an extended day/night cycle) or through announcements, to curb excessive resource accumulation.
    - Could support building small bases if desired, striking a balance between permanence and resource farming.

### Travel & Mobility Enhancements
- Discussed multiple traversal aids for this dimension:
    - Early game elytra availability.
    - Ashwood trees that enable short-range teleportation.
    - Mythic mounts, including four themed creatures such as a pegasus, flying snake, and a whimsical “pigasis” (a pig with wings and horse legs), plus one more to round out the set each with a pun-based name.

## Shrines Reimagined as Anomalies
- Proposed renaming Shrines to **Anomalies**, shifting the focus from being static reward stations to curious, mysterious features found within Rifts.
- Aim is to provide meaningful side objectives beyond primary goals.
- Draft prompt for design exploration:
    - *What anomalies exist in the Rift?*
    - *How did they get there?*
    - *What happens when you interact with them, and why?*
- Rewards or buffs shouldn’t be the main design driver, though general categories can be suggested.
- Plan to introduce three or four types of anomalies with possible expansion in future
- Once consensus is reached add 'Anomalies' to glossary

## Rift Sickness
- **Rift Sickness:** Canonical reason most inhabitants don’t delve into Rifts; likened to motion sickness but more intense, leading to dizziness and unconsciousness if exposure is prolonged. Specialized charms might mitigate this.
- Being able to traverse Rifts is framed as:
    - A rare natural trait, much like being born with blue eyes.
    - Or potentially the result of blessings, genetic mutations, or simply fate.
- Established that NPCs (non-player characters) have existed as Rift Wanderers long before players arrive, anchoring the concept in the world’s history.
- Rifts themselves are unstable spaces, reinforcing the danger and rarity of traversing them.
- Counterpoint brought up as this frames any wanderer as being special in someway as opposed to just a brave or curious individual who set out on an adventure
- This could lead to a distinct path for the direction of lore and world

## Materials
- Attention called to materials topic (like metals, cloth, wood, and stone) intended to enrich the crafting and narrative ecosystem.

---

## Loot Goblins
- Attention called to loot goblins topic intended to act as piñata-style foes

---

## Documentation
- Repository for documentation was recently overhauled to address technical constraints, resulting in a new look. 
- While some links broke in the process, all prior data remains intact.
- The upgrade bypasses previous technical limitation and hopeful to encourage more contributions, especially from newer docs team members.

---

## Closing Points
- Awaiting outcomes on several upcoming votes, especially the hub world, to guide next phases.
- Ended with open floor for final comments and mutual encouragement.
