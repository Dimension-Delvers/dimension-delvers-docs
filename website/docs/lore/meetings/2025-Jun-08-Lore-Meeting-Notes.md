# Workshop #7 – Hub & Essence (Meeting Notes – June 8, 2025)

> _Hub world purpose and design models, multiplayer instancing, essence logic and gameplay integration_

---

> ## Hub World

What a Hub World should be? Structurally, narratively, and technically. Strong creative interest, but ongoing questions around implementation and scalability.

### Purpose
- Give guilds a shared anchor space that evolves over time.
- Provide a canvas for storytelling, atmosphere, and game logic outside overworld constraints.
- Enable multiplayer engagement, server events, and dynamic content delivery.

### Progression
- City starts small or “dead” and grows with reputation gain or key choices.
- Barriers (walls, locked doors, invisible gates) gate progress.
- Layered realities: multiple “versions” of the same hub depending on player progress.
- Player choice (e.g., which guild to unlock).

### Multiplayer
- Player/team instance vs. shared server
    - Instanced: more personal, but hits performance and community
    - Shared: better for events, but progression disparity
- Reputation gating w/ barriers might help

---

> ## Port Ferris

A multiversal trade nexus inspired by *Babylon 5*. Neutral ground for guilds, diplomats, and travelers. Built around the Rift as a central transport mechanism.

---

> ## Maze City

A disorganized, liminal space resembling old European towns or ghostly cyber networks. Guilds “move in” as they’re unlocked. Evolving city meets cozy sim-game vibes.

---

> ## Echoes

A hub that adapts to player behavior and guild alliances. Reflects player identity, offering comfort and continuity. Changes visually and functionally as trust is built. Focused on themed style based on world type.

---

> ## Nexus

A communal server hub built by long-lost Wanderers. Districts appear as server-state changes. Foundation for lore and multiplayer server events.

---

> ## Chrysalis

A living sanctuary that grows organically, room-by-room. Players choose which guild or area to awaken next. Visual metaphor for inner transformation.

---

> ## Claims

A mystic, astral-inspired hub shaped entirely by team/player effort. Feels 'carved' from void. Emphasizes exploration and permanence.

---

> ## Essences

Establishing a consistent logic that blends progression, resource management, and aesthetic storytelling.

### Core Questions
- What is essence? What should it actually drive?
- Should it be universal or modular across mods and systems?
- How abstract or tangible should it be?

---

> ## Integration & Storage

- Backpack upgrades can void or convert junk blocks into essences.
- *Create* mod integration discussed (fluid handling, processing systems).
- Dedicated essence containers proposed for better storage and sorting.

---

> ## Gameplay Impact

- Essences tie directly into worldgen and loot logic via Rifts.
- Aesthetic consistency is a priority – avoid clashing biomes in the same Rift.
- Rift creation will vary between random discovery and targeted generation using essences.

> ## Latest Submitted Essence Concept

### Different Processing Methods
- **Unraveling** → Basic essence (Cords)
- **Fraying** → Specific essence types (Fibers)
- **Shredding** → Targeted conversion of blocks into specific essence types

- Aimed to avoid overwhelming players with 100+ types. ~32 unique items.
- Designed with focus on opening, shaping, or modifying rifts.
- Categorized into broad concepts (Organic, Structural, Reactive, etc.).
- Organized by source (e.g., block origin).
