## [Material](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1387618332756410498/1387618332756410498)
- Discussion of **[Metal](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1387618332756410498/1389765218183282830)** concept:
    - Moving focus from brass to **copper** that is altered by Rift energy.
    - Process similar to **Shimmer from Terraria** or the **Elven portal from Botania** where items transform when passed through.
    - Instead of relying on the portal model, players could use a bucket to scoop out "liquid fabric" of space.
    - Suggested names: **Altered Copper**, **Rift Blessed Copper**, also drew inspiration from D&D’s **Orium** (a toxic but valuable Feywild metal).
    - Other ideas included: **Phase Metal**, **Echo Alloy**, **Shift Metal**, **Limbro**.
    
- Discussion of **[Wood](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1387618332756410498/1389771759921791137)** concept:
    - Focus on **Ashwood trees**, inspired by **Flatland**, envisioned as higher-dimensional organisms linked to **Yggdrasil**.
    - All Ashwood trees are connected across dimensions, forming a vast network.
    - Mechanics discussed:
      - Could allow **teleportation** or act as living gateways to a Hub world.
      - Unlike a typical portal frame, using Ashwood logs would require a **catalyst or special action** to open a rift.
      - Possibly using the **entire tree as a multi-block portal**, keeping it organic and distinct.
      - Turning Ashwood into planks yields **phase planks**, still linked to the world tree.

- Discussion of **[Fabric](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1387618332756410498/1389786561469747310)** concept:
    - When a rift collapses, it sheds a **plant-like organic fiber**, resembling dry grass or reeds.
    - A wanderer with residual Rift energy could **replant these fibers**, making them active again.
    - They grow like **reverse vines**, climbing up walls, producing cotton-like bulbs that can be harvested for silk and then woven into fabric.
    - Names proposed: **vinesilk velvet**, **riftweave silk**, **driftseed velvet**.
    - **Riftweave** could be the solid block form; initial harvest might be **vine string** or **vine silk**.

## [Ability Guild](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1386024438151249971/1386024438151249971)
- Discussion of **School** concept:
  - Academy offered as expanded idea
  - Could be more than just simple ability enhancement and could frame the pack
- Port over of previous concepts:  
  - [Threadwright](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1389732567808479232/1389732567808479232) - Tailor Mice, ability thread
  - [Felt](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1388038169391267960/1388038169391267960) - Mushroom Hive-mind Muppets 
  - [Ladies of the Line](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1388047396667392000/1388047396667392000) - Victorian Dress / Magic girl, parasol wand

## [Essence Guild](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1388685966818148403/1388685966818148403)
- Broke into three high-level archetypes:
    - **Sages**: mystical lineage with ties to existing lore.
    - **Craftsman family**: secrets passed through generations.
    - **Science/research guild**: more experimental approach.
- Plan is to draft all three as pitches by next Wednesday for a vote.
- **two or three options** for the vote to avoid a single forced path.

## [Gem Guild Leader](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1385631740189478964/1385631740189478964)
- Goal to rework **Gem Garners** guild leadership:
    - Shift from Greebles as leaders to (potentially a **crow species** who love shiny things.)
    - Greebles might instead be **hired help/pets**, or handled separately as loot goblins.
    - Options include splitting Greeble lore/art, using them for rune gem aspects, or creating simpler alternatives.
- Draft ideas for a Gem Guild leader to get better direction.

## Other Topics

### Hub World & Liminal Spaces
- Discussed making the **Hub** resemble nostalgic **liminal spaces**
- Ideas for an archipelago of islands connected by rift trees.
- Acknowledged the **Hub might not come until the 0.3.0 update**, so guilds need to stand alone first.
---
### Sages & Story Lore
- **Sages** are like retired level 20 D&D adventurers — powerful, mostly withdrawn or missing.
  - Queen Elizabeth Lavaria (Ever Burning Flame) rules the Hub, benevolent but acts only if threatened.
  - Edward Lindsay (Emperor of 100 Seas) is more conquest-driven, seeking challenges.
  - Concept to link these characters as **founders of the Hub**.
  - If not used may fit well as a campaign
---
### [Shrine Game Pitch](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1388628696822190090/1389674869100118208)
 - A pitch has been developed alongside Rachael's shrine work and is almost ready.
 - Wout welcomes at least one other competing idea for the shrine.
   - The goal is to avoid a "yes, no" vote scenario, encouraging more diverse options.
---
### [Essences](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1382855794827067483/1389745763596238881)
- Revisit the Essences concept and break it down to its basic forms.
- Find new approaches to categorizing blocks to build a foundation for the Essence system. 
- Examples:
  - Color
  - Elements (earth, water, wind, fire)
  - Source (living, ground, dimension)
  - Block properties (full, transparent, hardness, tool requirements)

### Pitch Process Clarification
- There was general uncertainty about how the lore pitch and review process is supposed to work.
- Questions were raised on whether it’s strictly a "yes/no" vote for a single pitch, or if multiple pitches can be approved simultaneously for proofs of concept.
- The pitch poll format was noted to allow "yes, no, or rework" options, but recent examples (like the Essences vote) didn’t follow this structure.
- The group acknowledged that the process is still largely defined by precedent and collective decision.
- Discussion on whether the vote for which story direction to pursue should take place within Lore Review.
- Current plan is to have all three pitches written up, then hold form a consensus.
- The only formal nodes referenced were under Lore tasks and the pinned tasks post, which outline owner responsibilities but not voting.
- It was unclear if the group should go through the full pitch-to-feature pipeline when only discussing the story aspect.
- There may need to be a separate pitch later for the guild’s mechanics like creation and manipulation.
- Suggestion that Lore Review might be the venue where different story-based pitches (e.g. scientific vs sage approaches) are posted and discussed.
- Under this approach, separate posts would detail each pitch and follow the yes/no/rework format.
- Once a pitch is chosen, does it move to Lore Canon?
- Step five would involve collaborating with the Lore leadership team to formally adopt it into canon.
- Only one idea would be fully accepted for the specific task, though others could be repurposed.
- There was also speculation that depending on the vote outcome, one, two, or even all three might proceed.
- After the initial vote, a full pitch would be drafted with more gameplay details.
- ### Suggested to talk with CJ or Doro to get further clarity on the process.
