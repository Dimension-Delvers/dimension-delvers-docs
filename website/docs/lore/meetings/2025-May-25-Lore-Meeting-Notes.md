> ## Hub World

There is broad agreement that a Hub World could be a strong addition to the modpack, but there are still questions around its necessity and value.

### Purpose
- Give guilds a shared space thatâ€™s visually cohesive and expandable.
- Reduce malformed terrain generation issues.
- Centralize the modpack and tie everything together.
- Enables control over storytelling, mood, and custom music.

### Technical Benefits
- Improves server performance by isolating heavy calculations.
- Avoids TPS issues from overworld entities (e.g., Mine Colonies).
- Could allow modded access to the hub from player bases.

### Concerns & Pushback
- Some question the ROIâ€”too much work for unclear gain.
- Might overshadow the overworld or alienate vanilla players.
- Could overwhelm players if too visually or structurally busy.

### Multiplayer Complications
- Should the hub be per player, per team, or shared server-wide?
- Shared hubs might make new players feel left behind.
- Per-player hubs raise concerns around world size and performance.

### Gameplay Considerations
- Avoid making the hub a gimmick.
- Should reinforce gameplayâ€”especially around guilds.
- Alternatives should be considered and encouraged.

### Next Steps
- No decision made yet, discussion ongoing.
- Collect alternatives from the community.
- Other ideas (e.g., per-guild dimensions) were floated.
- Forum post or contributor call-to-action may follow.
