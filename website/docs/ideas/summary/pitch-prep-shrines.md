## Overview
Referred to as Anomalies for the remainder of this document.

Anomalies (previously referred to as Shrines, Rift Tears, or Altars) are interactable entities/blocks found inside rifts. They give players a **temporary buff** when interacted with, serving to add meaningful interaction and variety to rift spaces.

This concept primarily proposes **replacing some existing 3x3 POIs with anomalies**, resulting in more interesting encounters instead of empty or repetitive POIs.

## Mechanics

- **Spawn behavior**
    - Randomly replaces some 3x3 POIs in rift rooms with anomalies.
    - This does **not remove all 3x3 POIs**, only introduces the possibility for them to be anomalies instead.
    - Larger sizes (e.g. 5x5) may be considered later, with the possibility to downscale to 3x3 due to room constraints.

- **Interaction**
    - Players simply interact (likely right-click) to interact with the anomaly.
    - On closing, the anomaly releases energy that provides a **temporary buff**.
    - Might also include secondary effects like items or mobs dropping out depending on size (per later lore discussion).

- **Non-objective**
    - Not a primary rift objective. Meant as optional, additional content.

- **Implementation scope**
    - Initially focused on 3x3 POIs.
    - Potential for additional types or sizes in the future.

## Lore Discussion

### Variants / Types
- Types discussed in the lore conversations include:
    - **Guild anomalies**: anomalies influenced by guild activities.
    - **Sage anomalies**: anomalies touched by Sage interference.
    - **Anomalies**: naturally occurring dimensional instabilities.

### Environmental & Sensory details
- Anomalies may have:
    - Ambient sounds (buzzing, harmonic resonance, humming similar to electrical transformers).
    - Possible local block effects (e.g. small scale block disappearance).
- Visual and audio responses on closing, such as:
    - Good: sparkles and uplifting sounds (“boom”).
    - Bad: particles and down sounds (“womp-womp”).

### Size
- Most discussed implementation is a **3x3 footprint (normal POI size)**.
- Larger anomalies (5x5) suggested for future, especially to help players understand varying rarity and impact of anomalies.

## Additional Notes from Lore Meetings

- **Why does closing give a buff?**
    - Releases stored dimensional energy that naturally gets absorbed by the player, granting temporary enhancements.

- **Anomalies as environmental storytelling**
    - Could hint at the player's broader impact on dimensional stability.
    - May include dimension-themed structures, memory fragments, or guild artifacts.

- **Potential extensions discussed**
    - Having different types and appearances based on dimension themes.
    - Possibility of mobs or items dropping when anomalies are closed, if the anomaly size is large enough.

## Terminology
Based on discussions:
- **"Anomaly"** was a favored term.
- Other terms suggested:
    - **Scars**
    - **Shrines**
    - **Altars** 
    - **Dais**

## Summary

| Aspect                   | Details                                                       |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Replaces POIs**        | Randomly replaces some 3x3 POIs.                              |
| **Interaction**          | Player right-clicks.                                          |
| **Effect**               | Releases energy granting a temporary buff.                    |
| **Size**                 | Primarily 3x3, with future potential for 5x5.                 |
| **Not a main objective** | Optional side interaction inside rifts.                       |
| **Lore**                 | Leftovers, out of place, residual, ghosts, echoes, ripples    |
| **Visual/Audio**         | Subtle hums, possible block effects, distinct closing sounds. |
