<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp"><a class="header" href="#minimum-viable-product-mvp">Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-an-mvp"><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-mvp">What is an MVP?</a></h2>
<p>An MVP is a product with just enough features to satisfy the early players, and to provide feedback for future mod development. It is a product that is developed with the least amount of effort and resources, but still has enough features to be usable and valuable.</p>
<p>In other words, it is the "simplest" form of the mod as the team envisions it.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-an-mvp-important"><a class="header" href="#why-is-an-mvp-important">Why is an MVP important?</a></h2>
<p>An MVP is important because it allows the team to get feedback from the players early on in the development process. We set up an MVP to get something available fast. Our hope is that by doing so, the  team could get to work early, without having to wait for a decision process.</p>
<p>We also firmly believe that seeing is understanding. Having the players actually test the features will help them better understand and allows them to give feedback based on actual experience.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-polling-process"><a class="header" href="#what-about-the-polling-process">What about the polling process?</a></h2>
<p>We split the tasks in the MVP into 3 categories, Spike, Proof of Concept (PoC) and Feature (see <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a>). While a feature is a certainty, the other two are not. The polling process ican still make these PoCs and Spikes into actual features, but they might also be getting scrapped completely. The developers should be aware that anything they make is not considered final until a poll is done.</p>
<h2 id="the-3-levels-of-features"><a class="header" href="#the-3-levels-of-features">The 3 Levels of features</a></h2>
<p>We identify 3 levels of features, with varying degrees of decidedness.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature</strong>: Something that is already decided or we have to do this either way. <em>Example: Rift Generation, Structure Generation, Modifier System, Remove Durability</em></li>
<li><strong>Proof of Concept (PoC)</strong>: One of the suggestions given by people. By creating a PoC, we will be able to test it out. If we only have 1 implemented PoC and we are all satisfied, then we might as well make it core. If we have a PoC and people have clear issues with the gameplay it brings, we must spend time on another PoC. <em>Example: Gear Sockets, Skill Crystals, Cost of dying, Abilities</em></li>
<li><strong>Spike</strong>: A spike is something we know we need, but we have not yet discussed how to do it, or maybe we have discussed it, but no clear path to implementation. Spikes can be very exploratory, sometimes even involving a mini PoC. Spikes generally should not be too long, just enough time to prove it might work. <em>Example: Multiblock Altar, Wireframe Minimap</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mvp-featurelist"><a class="header" href="#mvp-featurelist">MVP Featurelist</a></h2>
<p>The MVP contains following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Stat System - Should be easily accessible from other systems
<ul>
<li><em>Spike</em>: Vanilla Attributes =&gt; Make a list of Vanilla attributes and missing attributes we need</li>
<li><em>Feature</em>: Entity Modifiers, based on vanilla Enchantment code, but better, for <strong>max Datapacking power</strong> =&gt; Usable for Gear Sockets, Implicits, Skill Trees, Food, Collectable unlocks, Levelling system, Champion Mobs, ...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ability System
<ul>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Abilities are datapackable and allow for a lot of variety. They have cooldowns and are each triggered by a configurable keybind.</li>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Abilities are stored on an item that you equip in a set of special slots</li>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Abilities have a randomized Skill Tree that gives minor boosts to the ability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gear
<ul>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Socket System
<ul>
<li>Runegems drop that can be applied to gear to give it a modifier</li>
<li>Runegems have different tiers of power</li>
<li>Gear can have up to 6 sockets</li>
<li>Each Socket can only take one shape of runegems</li>
<li>The Rune Anvil is used to apply runegems to gear</li>
<li>Vanilla gear can also have Gear Sockets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Enchantments completely removed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rift

<p>The Mod code is located at the <a href="https://github.com/Dimension-Delvers/dimension-delvers-mod.git">dimension-delvers-mod GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
<p>The intent of the mod is to provide a primary framework for the modpack. In the long term, this should be standalone, but as we start out, we will focus on making the best mod for our own modpack.</p>
<h3 id="pack"><a class="header" href="#pack">Pack</a></h3>
<p>The Pack code is located at the <a href="https://github.com/Dimension-Delvers/dimension-delvers-pack.git">dimension-delvers-pack GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
<p>The pack will add additional things that around the mod to make it a full modpack.</p>
<h2 id="project-board"><a class="header" href="#project-board">Project Board</a></h2>
<p>Our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Dimension-Delvers/projects/1/views/1">project board</a>, contains a running list of all our open tasks. Anyone can pick up any ticket on this board. The coordinators will follow up, to ensure everything goes smoothly. The labels indicate the kind of work to be done for a ticket. There are 3 types of tasks on it, Feature, PoC and Spike.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature</strong>: Something that is already decided or we have to do this either way. This task is primarily coding work, most details should be ironed out already. <em>Example: Rift Generation, Structure Generation, Modifier System (our better version of enchantments)</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Proof of Concept (PoC)</strong>: The implementation of one of the suggestions given by people. By creating a PoC, we will be able to test it out, to help deciding if we want to continue on it. PoCs still require a lot of conversation, so try to involve the team as much as possible before implementing things. <em>Example: Gear Sockets, AbilitY Crystals, Cost of dying</em></li>
<li><strong>Spike</strong>: A spike is something we know we need, but we have not yet discussed how to do it, or maybe we have discussed it high level, but no clear path to implementation. Spikes can be very exploratory, sometimes even involving a mini PoC. Spikes generally should not be too long, just enough time to prove it might work. A lot of the work in a spike will be conversation, make sure to take control of any Spike topic you pick up, including summarizing any ongoing discord conversation on the topic (if not already done by a Coordinator). <em>Example: Multiblock Altar, Wireframe Minimap, fishing</em></li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="code-style"><a class="header" href="#code-style">Code Style</a></h1>
<p>A consistent code style helps to improve the approachability of code and reduce noise during pull requests caused by
conflicting IDE settings between developers.</p>
<h2 id="tools"><a class="header" href="#tools">Tools</a></h2>
<p>The project a few tools to detect and address style violations. These tools are run against all Pull Requests.</p>
<h3 id="spotless"><a class="header" href="#spotless">Spotless</a></h3>
<p>Spotless is a tool that both detects and corrects style issues. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indentation using spaces, not tabs</li>
<li>The order imports appear in</li>
<li>Removal of unused imports</li>
<li>Overall formatting of code</li>
<li>Some safe code changes such as removal of unnecessary boxing.</li>
</ul>
<p>To check for issues run the <code>spotlessCheck</code> gradle task - this will produce a report of all violations.
Then to fix issues run <code>spotlessApply</code>.</p>
<p>If there are portions of code for which spotless checks should not be applied - perhaps a section of code that
should be formatted in a particular way for readability - then it can be surrounded by a pair of comments containing
<code>spotless:off</code> and <code>spotless:on</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// spotless:off
public static final List&lt;Vector2i&gt; POSITIONS = List.of(
        new Vector2i(0, 1),
        new Vector2i(2, 3),
        new Vector2i(5, 8),
        new Vector2i(9, 13)
);
// spotless:on
</code></pre>
<h3 id="checkstyle"><a class="header" href="#checkstyle">Checkstyle</a></h3>
<p>Checkstyle is a tool that can only detect and report style issues. It can be run using the <code>checkstyleMain</code> gradle task. It has been configured to report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wildcard or star imports</li>
<li>Names that don't match the standard java style. e.g. packages should have all lowercase names, non-constant variables should start with a lowercase letter, method names should start with a lowercase letter</li>
<li>If statements that don't use braces</li>
<li>Declaration order - this checks that elements in a type are declared in the following order:
<ol>
<li>Static variables (public, then protected, then package, then private)</li>
<li>Instance variables (public, then protected, then package, then private)</li>
<li>Constructors</li>
<li>Methods</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Case statements with code that falls through to another case statement. e.g.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">switch (letter) {
    // This is fine, the case for 'a' has no code
    case 'a':
    case 'b':
        System.out.println("a or b");
        break;
    // This provokes a checkstyle error
    case 'c':
        System.out.println("only c");
    case 'd':
        System.out.println("only d");
}
</code></pre>
<p>This can be disabled by adding a comment of 'fall through' on the line before the case statement that can be fallen into.</p>
<p>Similar to spotless, checkstyle checks can be disabled using <code>CHECKSTYLE.OFF: &lt;Check&gt;</code> and <code>CHECKSTYLE.ON: &lt;Check&gt;</code> comment pairs. e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public void check() {
    // CHECKSTYLE.OFF: NeedBraces - You cannot tell me what to do
    if (false) return;
    // CHECKSTYLE.ON: NeedBraces
}
</code></pre>
<p>However checkstyle additionally supports using the <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@SuppressWarnings({ "checkstyle:NeedBraces", "checkstyle:MethodName", "checkstyle:DeclarationOrder" })
public class MyClass {
    public void BAD_METHOD_NAME() {
        if (true) return;
    }
    
    public int value;
}

<p>A lot of the content in WotR is added through a unique datapack format. Modpack makers can fully customize how specific things look and behave through easy to understand datapacks. Adding the datapack works exactly as it does in vanilla minecraft, so it shouldn't pose too much troubles.</p>
<h2 id="datapacks"><a class="header" href="#datapacks">Datapacks?</a></h2>
<p>New to making a datapack? The <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Creating_a_data_pack">MC wiki's datapack creation page</a> has you covered. Just imagine the below formats to be in the very same vanilla list and everything will work out just fine.</p>

<p>The namespace in a datapack works a bit like the mod name. Mods have their own datapacks included with their own namespace. The Wanderers of the Rift mod's namespace is <code>wotr</code>.

<p>Where walls, paths and floors comprise the bulk of the room.</p>
<p>Alt wall can be used for etching, and indicators like cracks.
Dark floor can be used in corners, further away from the path.
Planks will (almost) always be planks, for things like bridges.
Bricks can be used to indicate a more solid part.</p>
<p>Use these when making builds, both rooms and POIs, so the processors can easily target them.
<img src="builds/processor_blocks.png" alt="processor_blocks" /></p>
<p>Water can be used in the build as the themed liquid.</p>
<p>The other processor blocks can be used, but require a custom processor from the builder, and will be room specific, eg. a tree always needing logs.</p>
<h2 id="room-sizes"><a class="header" href="#room-sizes">Room Sizes</a></h2>
<p>The size of a room is indicated with a multiple of the gridlenght, being 15. The number between brackets indicates the fixed multiplier, in X, Y and Z direction, respectively.</p>
<p>Stable (3x3x3), standard room near the start, 47 blocks in every direction, and all doors easely reachable.<br />
Unstable (3xYx3), doors are not easely reachable anymore, and is used as a step between Stable and Chaos).<br />
Chaos (XxYxZ), doors are not in the center of a face anymore, has varying sizes, and makes the generated rift maze-like.</p>
<h2 id="room-builds"><a class="header" href="#room-builds">Room Builds</a></h2>
<p>All edges of the rooms need to be at least 3 blocks thick. This is not a hard rule, but try to have &gt;90% of the walls 3 blocks thick<br />
Leave spaces for POIs, which will be randomly generated on set positions. A jigsaw block needs to be placed in the center of the POI location.</p>
<p>Chaos rooms need 1/3 of their doors to remain open, with the jigsaw blocks inside them. Those doors need to be scattered around the room. The other doorways can be covered by processor blocks, but not by bedrock.</p>
<h2 id="room-naming"><a class="header" href="#room-naming">Room Naming</a></h2>
<p>The created room has to be saved using the following structure:<br />
<code>wotr:rift/room/stability/XYZ/roomname_x_signature</code> ,<br />
Where Stability is Stable, Unstable or Chaos, XYZ is the size in every direction (1, 2 or 3), and roomname is the name of the room, chosen by the builder, x is the variation number, signature is the builders signature.<br />
Example: <code>wotr:rift/room/stable/333/testRoom_1_builderName</code>.</p>
<h2 id="poi-sizes"><a class="header" href="#poi-sizes">POI sizes</a></h2>
<p>The POI sizes will be (X, Y, Z):<br />
(3, 3, 3)*, (5, 5, 5), (7, 6, 7), (9, 8, 9), (11, 9, 11)*.<br />
This is the outer size of the POI, not counting the floor layer.<br />
*Up for debate, might very well be removed.
As a current rule of thumb, place at least an equal amount of rift chest as the size of the PoI.
For example. In a 3,3,3 PoI place at least 3 chests.
No decision has been made yet on the generation of the chests but this allows for many future options, such as x% of the chests will be generated.</p>
<p>Additionally make sure that the PoI jigsaw block has been setup properly to allow for a clean replacement and or rotation.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="processor-workings"><a class="header" href="#processor-workings">Processor workings</a></h2>
<p>The processors inputs a theme and a room, and turns the processor blocks in that room into the according blocks that the theme provides.<br />
The room is made from different processor blocks, that dictate the layout.<br />
The theme is a sort of dictionary, translating every processor block into several themed blocks, with a given weighting.<br />
For example: for cave theme, <code>processor_block_1</code> turns into 80% stone, 20% andesite. For wood theme, <code>processor_block_1</code> turns into 60% oak planks, 20% birch planks, 20% dark oak planks.</p>
<p>Themes are WIP</p>
<h2 id="fixed-and-extra-processor-blocks"><a class="header" href="#fixed-and-extra-processor-blocks">Fixed and Extra Processor blocks</a></h2>
<p>Processor blocks 1 through 7 are fixed, every theme can replace them.<br />
Processor blocks 8 through 14 are extra, not fixed, and a seperate processor has to be provided, specific to that room. That processor runs along additionally to the standard processor, so both pools can be used.<br />
Additional processors can be re-used, so multiple rooms can use the same additional processor. This means that multiple rooms can have a demand for themed glass, for example, even though themed glass is not a fixed processor. The required additional processor has to be indicated in the "Extra processor blocks used" forum.</p>
<p>Correct notation is WIP</p>
<h2 id="more-processor-capabilities"><a class="header" href="#more-processor-capabilities">More Processor capabilities</a></h2>
<p>There are processors that can place flowers and mushrooms on the floor, cobweb and vines against the wall, and fill flower pots with a long list of flowers, and alike. They can run over a room on request, or be theme dependent. This means that they dont have to be placed by the builder.<br />
Sometimes, it may be useful to pick an extra processor block dedicated to eg. leaves, to be sure leaves are placed in a tree-top shape.<br />
When choosing a leave block, if a oak leaves was chosen, the theme will potentially change these to different themed leaves to match the theme.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1-setting-up"><a class="header" href="#chapter-1-setting-up">Chapter 1: Setting up</a></h2>
<p>To get started with building for WotR, first you need to download <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/download/windows/">Prims modloader</a>.<br />
And the builders <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1328761294085554176/1336719831537553469/1352027237821710509">modpack</a>.</p>
<p>After setting up Prism, click on "Add Instance", "Import", "Browse" and locate the Builders Modpack you've just downloaded.</p>
<p>Another great tool to download is the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1328761294085554176/1336719831537553469/1352674512340258966">resource pack</a>, which is used to indicate the status of your builds. Launch the Builders Mod, go to "Options", "Resource Packs", "Open Pack Folder" and place the resource pack .zip in here.
Make sure you enable it by pressing the arrow on the icon.</p>
<p>Before you can get on the Builders Server, put your minecraft name in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1328761294085554176/1336719831537553469">Build Server Whitelist channel</a>. Offline building is also possible.
The last thing you need to do, is putting your Discord name and timezone in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1328761294085554176/1335631637769097236/1341132646612336773">Builders Sheet</a>, and pick an unused signature. This sheet will be used throughout the tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-introduction-to-building"><a class="header" href="#chapter-2-introduction-to-building">Chapter 2: Introduction to building</a></h2>
<p>Before we can get started with building, we first need to cover the basics. It is also advised to follow a tutorial on the basics of both WorldEdit and Structure Blocks, but not required.</p>
<h3 id="rooms-and-pois"><a class="header" href="#rooms-and-pois">Rooms and POIs</a></h3>
<p>Rooms are the main structures the game is played in. This is what you travel through in a rift.<br />
POIs are the small structures inside rooms that contain loot and enemies.<br />
Those two are the main structures of the game, and will be randomly generated every time you open a rift.
There are several sizes for both of them. For POIs, which have a footprint of a square, we indicate that by the horizontal length.
The lenghts used are: 3,5,7,9, and 11.
For Rooms we do not use the length of a block to indicate size, but a multiple of 15 (and a bit), the details can be found in the Docs.
A (3x3x3) Room is 47 blocks long in X, Y and Z direction, respectively.</p>
<p>There are different varieties for both of them, lets start with Rooms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stable Rooms: Always 3x3x3, and well-reachable doors. You don't need to build or break, nor travel long distances, to reach all exits.
These rooms are the first encountered when opening a Rift.</li>
<li>Unstable Rooms: 3xYx3 Rooms, they have varying height. The doors are not always well-reachable, and they are found around Stable rooms.</li>
<li>Chaos Rooms: Varying sizes, between 1 and 3. Those rooms do not have doors in the center of the faces, but on multiple fixed possible places.
They are placed on the outside of the Rift.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also varieties of POIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free: Free standing POIs can be placed all over the floor.</li>
<li>In-Wall: POIs that fully carve into the wall, like a cave.</li>
<li>Halfway: POIs that are half insid- and half outside (rounded up) the wall.</li>
<li>Ceiling: Those POIs are placed on the ceiling of the rooms, like a chandelier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="structure-blocks-and-jigsaw-blocks"><a class="header" href="#structure-blocks-and-jigsaw-blocks">Structure blocks and Jigsaw blocks</a></h3>
<p>The created structures are saved using structure blocks. If you use the templates, those are provided. Do not forget to use them to save, however.
Jigsaw blocks are the blocks that make generation of Rooms and POIs possible. They are pre-configured too.</p>
<h3 id="processor-blocks-1"><a class="header" href="#processor-blocks-1">Processor blocks</a></h3>
<p>Processor blocks are the blocks we (mostly) use to create rooms and POIs. They will be themed with a processor every time they are generated in game. For example,
a processor block in a cave theme will turn into stone, but the same block in a forest theme will turn into wood. An example is shown below.
<code>image missing</code></p>
<h3 id="guides-in-game"><a class="header" href="#guides-in-game">Guides in game</a></h3>
<p>At the spawn location of the build server, a few guides are placed that give examples of the things above, and empty templates
are provided. On singleplayer, you can use the command: <code>command here</code> to spawn in the guideline pieces.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-building-and-rules"><a class="header" href="#chapter-3-building-and-rules">Chapter 3: Building and rules</a></h2>
<p>To get consistent and quality rooms, there are a few rules we agreed upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Naming: The created room has to be saved using the following structure:
<code>wotr:rift/room/stability/XYZ/main_feature-#-signature</code>.
Where Stability is Stable, Unstable or Chaos, XYZ is the size in every direction (1, 2 or 3), and mainfeature is the main feature of the room, chosen by the builder, # is the variation number, signature is the builders signature.
Example: wotr:rift/room/stable/333/testRoom_1_builderName.<br />
The created POI has to be saved as the following: <code>wotr:rift/poi/type/size/main_feature-#-signature</code>.<br />
Here, type is free, inwall, halfway or ceiling. Size is one of 3, 5, 7, 9 or 11.</li>
<li>Room surfaces: The surfaces of the Rooms need to be at least 3 blocks thick. This is to prevent a casual player to accidentally
dig into bedrock. This is not a hard rule, but around 90% of the surfaces need to have this thickness. The exception for this are (1xYx1) Chaos rooms, as they are too small otherwise, and may use 2 blocks thick surfaces.</li>
<li>POI chests and spawner: Every POI needs at least an amount of chests equal to its length, and 1 trial spawner.</li>
<li>When making a Chaos room, at least 1/3 of the doors must remain open. To close other doors, remove the jigsaw blocks. Do not
fill the doorway with bedrock, this will be generated automatically.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spawning-template"><a class="header" href="#spawning-template">Spawning template</a></h3>
<p>On the build server, a template for every structure is provided, and placed in an appropriate location. To make locating this easy, Stable room templates are light gray, Unstable room templates
are pink, and Chaos room templates are red. If there are no empty templates for the structure you want to build, please contact a
build coordinator.</p>
<p>In a singleplayer world, you can use the command <code>Command here</code> to spawn in the template of the structure you want to build.</p>
<h3 id="using-fixed-processor-blocks"><a class="header" href="#using-fixed-processor-blocks">Using fixed processor blocks</a></h3>
<p>There are fixed and custom processor blocks. Fixed processor blocks are always used for the same purpose, a wall processor block should always be used for walls.
Numbers 1-8 are fixed, see table below for their use. Use these when making builds, both rooms and POIs, so the processors can easily target them.
A theme will always make sure that those blocks will be turned into thematic blocks.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Color</th><th>ID</th><th>Name</th><th>Use</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Grey</td><td>1</td><td><code>processor_block_1</code></td><td>Walls</td></tr>
<tr><td>Orange</td><td>2</td><td><code>processor_block_2</code></td><td>Paths</td></tr>
<tr><td>Green</td><td>3</td><td><code>processor_block_3</code></td><td>Floors</td></tr>
<tr><td>Purple</td><td>4</td><td><code>processor_block_4</code></td><td>Alt Wall</td></tr>
<tr><td>Blue</td><td>5</td><td><code>processor_block_5</code></td><td>Dark Floor</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yellow</td><td>6</td><td><code>processor_block_6</code></td><td>Planks</td></tr>
<tr><td>Black</td><td>7</td><td><code>processor_block_7</code></td><td>Bricks</td></tr>
<tr><td>L_Blue</td><td>8</td><td><code>processor_block_8</code></td><td>Alt Path</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Where walls, paths and floors comprise the bulk of the room.</p>
<p>Alt wall can be used for etching, and indicators like cracks. Dark floor can be used in corners, further away from the path. Planks will (almost) always be planks, for things like bridges. Bricks can be used to indicate a more solid part.
The alt path can be used to surround the path, to make it blend in a bit more.
Water can be used as the themed liquid.</p>
<p>The specific blocks have a suffix like: <code>processor_block_1_slab</code>.
Every family of processor blocks contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full block</li>
<li>Pillar</li>
<li>Slab</li>
<li>Stairs</li>
<li>Wall</li>
<li>Button</li>
<li>Pressure plate</li>
<li>Fence</li>
<li>Fence gate</li>
<li>Bars</li>
<li>Door</li>
<li>Trapdoor</li>
</ul>
<p><code>picture</code></p>
<h3 id="using-custom-processor-blocks"><a class="header" href="#using-custom-processor-blocks">Using custom processor blocks</a></h3>
<p>You can also use custom processor blocks, if you want a block that does not fit in any of the fixed categories, or if you want a block
to always be from the same set.
Examples are: glass or wood. A glass block does not belong to Wall or Floor, but having the color randomly be generated is nice, so you can use a custom processor block for this.
When you are creating a tree, you always want this to be made out of wood, regardless of theme, so use a custom processor block for this too.
The reason those are not fixed processor blocks, is that only a small amount of structures will use them, and now the processor block number can be used for other things, with other structures.</p>
<p>If you use custom processor blocks, you must provide the processor yourself. This will be explained in a later Chapter.</p>
<p><code>Picture</code></p>

<p><em>Poll is up for this</em></p>
<h3 id="pois-in-rooms"><a class="header" href="#pois-in-rooms">POIs in Rooms</a></h3>
<p>When building a room, you need to include POIs. This can be done by adding Jigsaw Blocks. A POI will be generated against the Jigsaw, so it must be placed a bit further. This means that for a free standing poi, the Jigsaw must be placed 2 blocks deep in the floor. The same applies to halfway POIs, but for those you must also have the small line on the Jigsaw block towards you, and away from the wall. It should also be placed against the wall. The ceiling Jigsaw must be placed 2 layers in the ceiling. For the in-wall Jigsaw, however, placement is different. Those must be placed against the wall, with the face towards the wall. This is because when it generates, it generates towards the wall, and thus be placed inside. A placement example is on the server, or can be loaded with <code>jigsaw example name</code>.</p>
<p>Load <code>jigsaw_palette</code> to get the correct settings for all Jigsaw blocks. You can control middle-click the one you want, and place it on the correct location. They are named, so they are distinguishable in your inventory. Keep in mind how far the POI you place will reach in every dimension, they will destroy blocks when necessary! In-wall POIs do carve deep, and free standing go up high.</p>
<h3 id="server-build-indicators"><a class="header" href="#server-build-indicators">Server Build Indicators</a></h3>
<p>On the server, wool blocks are used to indicate the status of your Room, and the sizes of the POIs. If you've installed the resource pack, they have replaced the wool textures. POI size indicators have a number on them. The status blocks indicate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red: Still building.</li>
<li>Yellow: Would like feedback for finishing touches.</li>
<li>Lime: Finished, ready for review.</li>
<li>Blue: Want help with placing POIs.</li>
<li>Cyan: The POIs are placed by builder.</li>
</ul>
<p>To set your structure as finished, you have to add the name on the Builders sheet. Only then it can be put in the mod.</p>
<h3 id="saving"><a class="header" href="#saving">Saving</a></h3>
<p>To save your created structure, locate the structure block for saving. For rooms, they are the inner structure block. For
POIs, they are the top structure block. Make sure you use the correct naming convention, as written in rules.
<code>2 pictures missing</code></p>
<p>To allow the mod to use your structure, copy-paste the structure name into the Builders Sheet in the correct location (Room and POI
tabs). Ask in chat for a review.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4-making-processors"><a class="header" href="#chapter-4-making-processors">Chapter 4: Making processors</a></h2>
<p>To start with processor generation, download the following zip file:
<code>json_generator.zip</code> from <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1328761294085554176/1335631637769097236/1357334905922523236">here</a>.
It uses <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3</a>.
It is also useful to open Jade plugin setting in-game (num 0 by default), scroll down to the very bottom and enable both "Registry Name" and "Block States".
This makes you able to see the names of the blocks you want to use, and their properties.<br />
In the sheets, only the <strong>yellow</strong> cells should be filled in, but not all yellow cells need to be completed.</p>
<h3 id="custom-processors"><a class="header" href="#custom-processors">Custom processors</a></h3>
<p>To create a custom processor for 1 processor block, use <code>processor_single_sheet.xlsx</code>. If you want to use a custom processor for multiple processor blocks, use
<code>processor_multiple_sheet.xlsx</code> instead. You only need to fill in the yellow cells of the blocks you've used, but make sure it is for the right number processor block.
State is the block the processor block turns into, for example <code>minecraft:stone</code>, and step is the portion that will get this state. It is not equal to percentage,
as it scales exponentially down. A step size of 25 for block A and 75 for block B will give a 50/50 distribution when generated. The random noise used is simplex,
it will generate smooth, organic-looking patterns with continuous gradients, like layered spheres. The sum of the steps need to equal 1, anything higher will not get
used, and lower means some of the processor blocks will not get transformed.
Checksum will turn green if the total is 1, as indicator.</p>
<p>A processor will generate a number between 0 and 1, and will look what block it wants to replace.
Then, it will stack the steps from left to right, adding the numbers, and look for the block that belongs to this number.
Let's say it wants to replace <code>processor_block_10</code>, and generates number <code>0.7</code>. Now if, for example, in the spreadsheet you
have <code>minecraft:stone   0.6</code> and <code>minecraft:dirt   0.4</code>, it will replace <code>processor_block_10</code> into <code>minecraft_dirt</code>. If, instead,
the number generated was <code>0.3</code>, the block turns into <code>minecraft_stone</code>. So, every block is like another layer in an onion, with the step sizes
being the thickness of the layer, and the left-most step being the outer layer.</p>
<p>When you're done filling in the rows of the blocks you have used, save the sheet as:
<code>processor_single_sheet.csv</code> or <code>processor_multiple_sheet.csv</code>, respectively. Place this file in the same folder as the belonging python script
(<code>single_json_generator.py</code> or <code>multiple_json_generator.py</code>). Run this, and enter the type of structure you want this processor for, either Room or POI.
Do not change the output name, please.</p>
<p>The last thing to do, is filling in the name of your custom processor into the Builders sheet, and give the json file to a Build Coordinator.
When approved, they will put it into the mod, together with your structure.</p>
<h3 id="making-a-theme"><a class="header" href="#making-a-theme">Making a theme</a></h3>
<p>Before making a theme, please inform the Build Coordinator, to make sure it can get used and no double themes are made. To start making a theme, use the <code>processor_theme_sheet.xlsx</code> sheet.
Theme making is similar to custom processor making, but require a state for every processor block. This is because builders can use every fixed processor block, with the knowledge it
will be processed when generated. The checksum column should be fully green.
Save this as <code>processor_theme_sheet.csv</code>, and run the python script. Enter Room or POI (often you want both, so run twice), and pick the custom choices in the popup. For POIs this is
only a chest for now, so press "OK", and you're done. For rooms, more options are available. At the top, there are a few toggle options, for if you want mushrooms or not,
for example. Below that, under the "Attachments" section, there are more customizable options. A list of example attachments is below in Appendix A. This can
generate lanterns on the ceiling, rails on the floor, or bee nests on the walls, for example, but more are possible. "Name" is the name of the block you want to attach,
"Rarity" is how often it occurs (between 0 and 1), "Up" is if it requires to touch the ceiling, "Down" is for when it requires to touch a floor, "Sides" is for how many walls it has to
be up against, "Property" is a block property you can give it, and "Value" is the value of that property. Try different rarities and properties to find whatever suits your theme.
Using Jade in-game with the advanced settings enabled, you can find the properties in the box. It is currently not possible to adjust the "facing" property to the wall it touches, so
torches against the wall do not stick out of the wall, but are rotated.</p>

<li><strong>Point of Interest (PoI)</strong>:	A small structure that is generated inside the room, containing mob spawners and loot. They can be either: standing isolated on ground, partly inside the wall, in a corner, or hanging from the ceiling. All can have varying sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Doorway</strong>: A 3x5 hole in the wall, through which a player gets in or out of a room. They are on set locations, often (but not exlusively) 1 on each vertical face, so 4 per room. Rooms are generated from doorway to doorway, with a ring in between.</li>
<li><strong>Ring</strong>: A 3x5x1 ring of blocks, between 2 doorways. They are used to connect rooms, and to generate the next room.</li>
<li><strong>Stable room</strong>: A strictly 3x3x3 room, with a door in the middle of each verical face. All 4 doors are easely reachable from one another, without having to dig or travel large parts of the room. Stable rooms are the first rooms in the rift, and they are straightforward and coherent.</li>
<li><strong>Unstable room</strong>: A 3xYx3 room, with doors in the center only. The doors are not necessarily easily reachable, and a player might require to first travel to a corner, before having access to the door. Mostly used as a room between Stable and Chaos.</li>
<li><strong>Chaos room</strong>: All other rooms that are not Stable or Unstable. Doors are on set places, but not all door are open, and not every face has exactly 1 door. Those rooms are confusing and complex, and are placed on the outside of the rift.</li>

<h2 id="question"><a class="header" href="#question">Question</a></h2>
<p>Should we remove durability from the mod? It is by itself already a heated topic. As WotRift is a mod about upgrading your gear, losing an item to durability can be incredibly frustrating.</p>
<h2 id="discussion-thread"><a class="header" href="#discussion-thread">Discussion Thread</a></h2>

<p>The poll was ran from the 08/03/2025 until 15/03/2025 with the following results:

<h2 id="question-1"><a class="header" href="#question-1">Question</a></h2>
<p>Should we remove enchanting from the mod? It is by itself already a heated topic. WotRift will introduce a new modifier system that will make enchanting fairly obsolete.</p>
<h2 id="discussion-thread-1"><a class="header" href="#discussion-thread-1">Discussion Thread</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/1328761294085554176/1347962994335809546">Enchanting</a></p>

<h3 id="yes-remove-enchanting-completely"><a class="header" href="#yes-remove-enchanting-completely">Yes, remove Enchanting completely</a></h3>
<p>The enchanting table will no longer work and no enchantments can be applied to items. Will affect all vanilla and modded items.</p>
<p>Modded enchants in the pack that are necessary for mod features to work will be reworked into the modifier system.</p>
<p><em>Design note</em>: Something like this would require an adequate replacement for improving gear. The current Gear Sockets and runegem <em>PoC</em>, applicable to vanilla items too, covers such a need. Other directions with modifiers would require to keep this poll result into account.</p>
<h3 id="yes-but-only-remove-for-wotrift-items-1"><a class="header" href="#yes-but-only-remove-for-wotrift-items-1">Yes, but only remove for WotRift items</a></h3>
<p>The enchanting table will not work for items from the WotRift mod. Vanilla items and items from other mods will still be enchantable, but their enchants will be disabled in the rifts.</p>
<p><em>Technical note</em>: Disabling enchants in the rift is a very complex endeavor and will require a lot of work. This option thus is considered the worst possible option by the dev team.</p>
<h3 id="no-enchanting-should-stay-but-disabled-in-rifts"><a class="header" href="#no-enchanting-should-stay-but-disabled-in-rifts">No, Enchanting should stay, but disabled in rifts</a></h3>
<p>Enchanting will remain in the mod. Items can still be enchanted as normal. But most or all of the enchants will be disabled in rifts to prevent balancing issues.</p>
<p><em>Technical note</em>: See previous point.</p>
<h3 id="no-enchanting-should-stay-and-be-usable-in-rifts"><a class="header" href="#no-enchanting-should-stay-and-be-usable-in-rifts">No, Enchanting should stay and be usable in rifts</a></h3>
<p>Enchanting will remain in the mod. Items can still be enchanted as normal. Rifts will be balanced around this, this will make the modifier system less useful and less impactful, especially when overpowered modded enchants are added. Consideration need to be made to make enchanting the main modifier system.</p>

<h2 id="-summary-and-decisions-"><a class="header" href="#-summary-and-decisions-">== Summary and decisions ==</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A LOT of movements towards MVP in Rune Anvil/Socket, Rift Generation, Modifier System, Inventory Snapshots, Accessibility Configs, Builder Glasses, Rift Entry Portal, 3Dd Rift Mapper, First Chest Variant, Dev Tools.</li>
<li>Devs please delete branches that have been merged in.</li>
<li>Rift mapper is running and will be 3d because rift will have height as well.</li>
<li>Durability is removed from everything because durability is lame.</li>
<li>Accessibility setting added for different things that can be adjusted.</li>
<li>Rift entrance visual has been created.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-game-design-"><a class="header" href="#-game-design-">== Game Design ==</a></h2>
<p>Rifts:
Rift key - determining what this is/ how the player will create is really important for making progress in MVP
Rift entrance, themes, tiered rift levels, spawners, RiftMapper are also things to discuss.</p>
<p>Progression:
Skill trees - do we want or no? How do we wanna do them? What is a skill tree?
Gear Progression - How do we progress gear? Just modifiers or add more?
Gear base - how to make weapon/armor more unique?
Skill Mechanic - What type of skills will we have
Build-A-Spell - How do we want to do spells and have them easily expandable.
Abilities -
Endgame - what do we want to do for endgame? What should the player be working for? Please go discuss.</p>
<p>Other:
Durability - Gone
Unique Biomes - should this be in Overworld? What rift related things do we want to have in overworld?
Damage Types - how would we want to implement this? What type of damage types would we want?
Eras of Progression - Barry Summary: 5 eras, Era of Exploration keeps it pretty basic and goal is to introduce the player to the core mechanics of the modpack that are different from vanilla minecraft, Era of Expansion we start to add onto the core concepts bringing in some of the more complex aspects such as potentially modifying rifts/gear, skills open up alot more etc., Era of Stabilization/Experimentation Player has a decent grasp on what the pack adds and maybe has a build/playstyle they are actively working towards, or are experimenting with alot of playstyles and builds, Era of Perfection all tools are available to the player, probably the most grindy era focus is on perfecting the build and entering endgame content, Era of Conclusion the player is fully into the endgame and maybe big final boss fight, not all players necessarily make it here and thats ok.

<p>Key forge demo - rift key forge shown with different materials and different rift tiers being able to be created from more “expensive” materials. Materials used determine the theme of the rift. New portal texture and it is very cool.</p>
<p>Rift update - Portal room has 4 entrances/exits, performance side needs some work, rift level determines rift size, level 20 rift is bigger than the biggest vaults in VH, hallways are being removed.</p>
<p>Ditto Blocks - Added blocks that can copy the texture of other blocks, which allows us to give blocks different properties. One that was showcased was “Spring Blocks” which would have a trampoline like effect for the player. There is slight differentiation so you can tell the difference, they can be traps or be mined and used as a tool. “Trap Blocks” were also shown which disappear after a short time to drop the player below. There are also variations specifically to trigger on mob vs player.</p>
<p>Build server - needs more rooms and more POI’s please fill out form in build section for room ideas, feedback on rooms, take note of the structures and the processor blocks that have code currently, if you need a special one make note of it and preferably also code it. There is a room section and a POI section, we need more thoughts/examples for both.</p>

<p>Tiebreaker poll for name - Wanderers of the Rift won! We will start using the new name.</p>
<p>New channel called community polls - used for polls to community, 1st poll is durability poll to decide if we are keeping durability.</p>
<p>Enchanting - do we want Vanilla like enchanting in the game and to what extent. Check out discussion in the forums. Probably going to have poll on enchanting poll next week.</p>
<h2 id="-mvp-updates--2"><a class="header" href="#-mvp-updates--2">== MVP Updates ==</a></h2>
<p>We really need rooms! We only have two rooms and one POI.</p>
<p>Builds are really important so we can have interesting rifts. We are wanting to aim for even more than VH.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to throw something down even if you don't consider yourself good at building.</p>
<p>Decision Process - Discussion in voice or chat -&gt; Idea polishing in Forums -&gt; Polling for options (more than 2) -&gt; Guidelines / Results published on mdBook once decision is taken -&gt; Changes/Actions timelines depending on decisions.</p>
<p>Also reference guide in mdBook:  https://dimension-delvers.github.io/dimension-delvers-docs/polls/polls.html</p>

<h2 id="-deemos-"><a class="header" href="#-deemos-">== Deemos ==</a></h2>
<p>Skill gem demo from Divides By Zero - Different gems would be upgradable with different number/tier of options. Skill trees are randomly generated per gem, so two base gems are not necessarily going to end up being the same.</p>
<p>Ability demo from Patrigan created by RobotMonkey - ability that summons skeletons and then they explode and die when they hit the ground. Cooldown indicator top left. Summoning of skeletons is completely configured using datapacks. We have alot of flexibility and depth that can be done using the current system.  Ball Ball ability which has bouncy balls. Think of making abilities that work well together.</p>

<li>The build team did an amazing job with the PoIs.</li>
<li>New contributors: Special K, Bullzey, xDorox, Galacitic, Quipz , and Rishtik.</li>
<li>Kudos to the docs team for documenting stuff, starting with future gameplay ideas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-docs-team-"><a class="header" href="#-docs-team-">== Docs Team ==</a></h2>
<p>Join the docs team if interested in summarizing things and taking control of the mdbook.
https://discord.com/channels/1328761294085554176/1351952772261482566
The docs team will be responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making summaries of stuff.</li>
<li>Maintaining the mdbook or wiki.</li>
<li>Assisting the coordinators with summarizing conversations and topics.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-pitch-to-feature-"><a class="header" href="#-pitch-to-feature-">== Pitch to Feature ==</a></h2>
<p>The future gameplay ideas has several issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Messy duplicate threads.</li>
<li>No summaries.</li>
<li>Topics that stay in future gameplay ideas forever.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pitch-forum"><a class="header" href="#pitch-forum">Pitch forum</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Will be only visible to contributors of the project - shift from the future gameplay ideas.</li>
<li>This will be the first entry point to new content.</li>
<li>The pitch will be high level.</li>
<li>The pitch will pass with the coordinators first.</li>
<li>It's also going to be closer to the MVP, each pitch should be implementable within one version.</li>
<li>There will be no pitches for adding other mods right now.</li>
<li>The pitch forum will end with an acceptance poll that requires 2/3 (66%) majority.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="feature-forum"><a class="header" href="#feature-forum">Feature Forum</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The feature forum will be on the same level as the project forum.</li>
<li>Topics go in once they pass the acceptance poll and most importantly when a dev is available to start working on it.</li>
<li>The feature forum will have the in depth discussion.</li>
<li>The Docs team will be monitoring that closely to make sure it stays summarized as much as possible.</li>
<li>The feature should stay close to the pitch.</li>
<li>Small changes are possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="considerations"><a class="header" href="#considerations">Considerations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Should not consider the level of effort.</li>
<li>Must be doable within one major version increment (e.g., update 16 to update 17 of Vault Hunters).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="feature-poll"><a class="header" href="#feature-poll">Feature Poll:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Consists of options like "accepted," "accepted, but needs adjustments," and "not accepted back to the drawing board."</li>
<li>The final step to decide if something is part of the mod.</li>
<li>Doesn't mean it's permanent; changes/reworks can be pitched.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="contributor-idea-forum"><a class="header" href="#contributor-idea-forum">Contributor idea Forum:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>For ideas and small expansions that don't impact the mods too much.</li>
<li>Wider design conversations (e.g., timers).</li>
<li>Tags will indicate the type of conversation.</li>
<li>Design conversations won't necessarily lead to implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-4"><a class="header" href="#example-4">Example:</a></h3>
<p>Riftmapper</p>
<ul>
<li>Cases like the rift mapper should fall under the pitch.</li>
<li>If a pitch is obvious, they will do the acceptance poll.</li>
<li>"With the things like the big ones, pitch to feature will be the way to go."
Goal: To have a nice process flow from start to finish.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reasoning-behind-pitch-to-feature-workflow"><a class="header" href="#reasoning-behind-pitch-to-feature-workflow">Reasoning behind Pitch to feature workflow:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Currently there are many open threads on new features without any sight on when this will be implemented</li>
<li>This should allow for a more streamline indication of what is being worked on and what isn't</li>
<li>Pitches and features will be closely monitored to avoid duplicates</li>
<li>Problem: Expectations were set, but nothing came to a conclusion.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-notes"><a class="header" href="#other-notes">Other notes:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In the case of Lore ID will become a pitch, including how to make it come forward.</li>
<li>Feature Gameplay ideas: Will be locked for a certain amount of time to ensure clarity.</li>
<li>Will not be a core part of the flow but may be used for public debate.</li>
<li>Contributor ID forum will also be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hot Topics</p>
<ul>
<li>Baby Ghost (Ghastling): Introduced at Minecraft Live.</li>
<li>Rift Stability and Timers: very interesting conversation on this.</li>
<li>A decision on values was made before consulting the team, see later points for more info.</li>
</ul>

<li>New values can be added if they don't overlap with existing ones.</li>
<li>Values will be open and interpretable as they are.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-feature-to-feature-process-"><a class="header" href="#-feature-to-feature-process-">== Feature to Feature Process ==</a></h2>
<p>• A final poll will be opened alongside the discussion, with options: accepted, not accepted, accepted but needs fine-tuning, and not accepted needs big changes.
