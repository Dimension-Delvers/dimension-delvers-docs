<h2 id="what-is-an-mvp"><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-mvp">What is an MVP?</a></h2>
<p>An MVP is a product with just enough features to satisfy the early players, and to provide feedback for future mod development. It is a product that is developed with the least amount of effort and resources, but still has enough features to be usable and valuable.</p>
<p>In other words, it is the "simplest" form of the mod as the team envisions it.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-an-mvp-important"><a class="header" href="#why-is-an-mvp-important">Why is an MVP important?</a></h2>
<p>An MVP is important because it allows the team to get feedback from the players early on in the development process. We set up an MVP to get something available fast. Our hope is that by doing so, the  team could get to work early, without having to wait for a decision process.</p>
<p>We also firmly believe that seeing is understanding. Having the players actually test the features will help them better understand and allows them to give feedback based on actual experience.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-polling-process"><a class="header" href="#what-about-the-polling-process">What about the polling process?</a></h2>
<p>We split the tasks in the MVP into 3 categories, Spike, Proof of Concept (PoC) and Feature (see <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a>). While a feature is a certainty, the other two are not. The polling process ican still make these PoCs and Spikes into actual features, but they might also be getting scrapped completely. The developers should be aware that anything they make is not considered final until a poll is done.</p>
<h2 id="the-3-levels-of-features"><a class="header" href="#the-3-levels-of-features">The 3 Levels of features</a></h2>
<p>We identify 3 levels of features, with varying degrees of decidedness.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature</strong>: Something that is already decided or we have to do this either way. <em>Example: Rift Generation, Structure Generation, Modifier System, Remove Durability</em></li>
<li><strong>Proof of Concept (PoC)</strong>: One of the suggestions given by people. By creating a PoC, we will be able to test it out. If we only have 1 implemented PoC and we are all satisfied, then we might as well make it core. If we have a PoC and people have clear issues with the gameplay it brings, we must spend time on another PoC. <em>Example: Gear Sockets, Skill Crystals, Cost of dying, Abilities</em></li>
<li><strong>Spike</strong>: A spike is something we know we need, but we have not yet discussed how to do it, or maybe we have discussed it, but no clear path to implementation. Spikes can be very exploratory, sometimes even involving a mini PoC. Spikes generally should not be too long, just enough time to prove it might work. <em>Example: Multiblock Altar, Wireframe Minimap</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mvp-featurelist"><a class="header" href="#mvp-featurelist">MVP Featurelist</a></h2>
<p>The MVP contains following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Stat System - Should be easily accessible from other systems
<ul>
<li><em>Spike</em>: Vanilla Attributes =&gt; Make a list of Vanilla attributes and missing attributes we need</li>
<li><em>Feature</em>: Entity Modifiers, based on vanilla Enchantment code, but better, for <strong>max Datapacking power</strong> =&gt; Usable for Gear Sockets, Implicits, Skill Trees, Food, Collectable unlocks, Levelling system, Champion Mobs, ...</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>The Mod code is located at the <a href="https://github.com/Dimension-Delvers/dimension-delvers-mod.git">dimension-delvers-mod GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
<p>The intent of the mod is to provide a primary framework for the modpack. In the long term, this should be standalone, but as we start out, we will focus on making the best mod for our own modpack.</p>
<h3 id="pack"><a class="header" href="#pack">Pack</a></h3>
<p>The Pack code is located at the <a href="https://github.com/Dimension-Delvers/dimension-delvers-pack.git">dimension-delvers-pack GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
<p>The pack will add additional things that around the mod to make it a full modpack.</p>
<h2 id="project-board"><a class="header" href="#project-board">Project Board</a></h2>
<p>Our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Dimension-Delvers/projects/1/views/1">project board</a>, contains a running list of all our open tasks. Anyone can pick up any ticket on this board. The coordinators will follow up, to ensure everything goes smoothly. The labels indicate the kind of work to be done for a ticket. There are 3 types of tasks on it, Feature, PoC and Spike.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature</strong>: Something that is already decided or we have to do this either way. This task is primarily coding work, most details should be ironed out already. <em>Example: Rift Generation, Structure Generation, Modifier System (our better version of enchantments)</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Proof of Concept (PoC)</strong>: The implementation of one of the suggestions given by people. By creating a PoC, we will be able to test it out, to help deciding if we want to continue on it. PoCs still require a lot of conversation, so try to involve the team as much as possible before implementing things. <em>Example: Gear Sockets, AbilitY Crystals, Cost of dying</em></li>
<li><strong>Spike</strong>: A spike is something we know we need, but we have not yet discussed how to do it, or maybe we have discussed it high level, but no clear path to implementation. Spikes can be very exploratory, sometimes even involving a mini PoC. Spikes generally should not be too long, just enough time to prove it might work. A lot of the work in a spike will be conversation, make sure to take control of any Spike topic you pick up, including summarizing any ongoing discord conversation on the topic (if not already done by a Coordinator). <em>Example: Multiblock Altar, Wireframe Minimap, fishing</em></li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="code-style"><a class="header" href="#code-style">Code Style</a></h1>
<p>A consistent code style helps to improve the approachability of code and reduce noise during pull requests caused by
conflicting IDE settings between developers.</p>
<h2 id="tools"><a class="header" href="#tools">Tools</a></h2>
<p>The project a few tools to detect and address style violations. These tools are run against all Pull Requests.</p>
<h3 id="spotless"><a class="header" href="#spotless">Spotless</a></h3>
<p>Spotless is a tool that both detects and corrects style issues. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indentation using spaces, not tabs</li>
<li>The order imports appear in</li>
<li>Removal of unused imports</li>
<li>Overall formatting of code</li>
<li>Some safe code changes such as removal of unnecessary boxing.</li>
</ul>
<p>To check for issues run the <code>spotlessCheck</code> gradle task - this will produce a report of all violations.
Then to fix issues run <code>spotlessApply</code>.</p>
<p>If there are portions of code for which spotless checks should not be applied - perhaps a section of code that
should be formatted in a particular way for readability - then it can be surrounded by a pair of comments containing
<code>spotless:off</code> and <code>spotless:on</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// spotless:off
public static final List&lt;Vector2i&gt; POSITIONS = List.of(
        new Vector2i(0, 1),
        new Vector2i(2, 3),
        new Vector2i(5, 8),
        new Vector2i(9, 13)
);
// spotless:on
</code></pre>
<h3 id="checkstyle"><a class="header" href="#checkstyle">Checkstyle</a></h3>
<p>Checkstyle is a tool that can only detect and report style issues. It can be run using the <code>checkstyleMain</code> gradle task. It has been configured to report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wildcard or star imports</li>
<li>Names that don't match the standard java style. e.g. packages should have all lowercase names, non-constant variables should start with a lowercase letter, method names should start with a lowercase letter</li>
<li>If statements that don't use braces</li>
<li>Declaration order - this checks that elements in a type are declared in the following order:
<ol>
<li>Static variables (public, then protected, then package, then private)</li>
<li>Instance variables (public, then protected, then package, then private)</li>
<li>Constructors</li>
<li>Methods</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Case statements with code that falls through to another case statement. e.g.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">switch (letter) {
    // This is fine, the case for 'a' has no code
    case 'a':
    case 'b':
        System.out.println("a or b");
        break;
    // This provokes a checkstyle error
    case 'c':
        System.out.println("only c");
    case 'd':
        System.out.println("only d");
}
</code></pre>
<p>This can be disabled by adding a comment of 'fall through' on the line before the case statement that can be fallen into.</p>
<p>Similar to spotless, checkstyle checks can be disabled using <code>CHECKSTYLE.OFF: &lt;Check&gt;</code> and <code>CHECKSTYLE.ON: &lt;Check&gt;</code> comment pairs. e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public void check() {
    // CHECKSTYLE.OFF: NeedBraces - You cannot tell me what to do
    if (false) return;
    // CHECKSTYLE.ON: NeedBraces
}
</code></pre>
<p>However checkstyle additionally supports using the <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@SuppressWarnings({ "checkstyle:NeedBraces", "checkstyle:MethodName", "checkstyle:DeclarationOrder" })
public class MyClass {
    public void BAD_METHOD_NAME() {

<p>A lot of the content in WotR is added through a unique datapack format. Modpack makers can fully customize how specific things look and behave through easy to understand datapacks. Adding the datapack works exactly as it does in vanilla minecraft, so it shouldn't pose too much troubles.</p>

<p>New to making a datapack? The <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Creating_a_data_pack">MC wiki's datapack creation page</a> has you covered. Just imagine the below formats to be in the very same vanilla list and everything will work out just fine.</p>

<p>QuickMover is a helper for defining the quickMove (shift-click) behavior in menus. It allows declaring the desired
movement of items between slots, with standard player inventory behavior built in. The implementation is designed
to work with both standard container slots and NeoForge's ItemHandler slots.</p>
<h2 id="usage-1"><a class="header" href="#usage-1">Usage</a></h2>
<p>Within a Menu, instantiate a QuickMover using its builder (via <code>QuickMover::create</code>). Using the builder the behavior
of individual slots, ranges of slots and the player inventory slots can be defined by providing the movements that should
be attempted when shift-clicking on those slots. The player slots should be defined first if present - this just needs
to provide the index of the first player slot. Doing so will add the default behavior of switching items between the
player's inventory and their hotbar if there are no other possible moves.</p>
<p>The implementation of <code>AbstractContainerMenu::quickMoveStack</code> should delegate to the <code>QuickMover::quickMove</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">private final QuickMover mover;

public MyMenu(int containerId/*, ... */) {
    //...
    mover = QuickMover.create(this)
            // Specify there are player slots and the slot they begin from.
            .forPlayerSlots(INPUT_SLOT_COUNT + OUTPUT_SLOT_COUNT)
            .tryMoveTo(0, INPUT_SLOT_COUNT)
            // Specify slot 0 will first try to move to slot 1, then to the player's inventory (including hot bar)

            .forSlot(1)
            .tryMoveTo(0)
            .tryMoveToPlayer()
            // Specify that slot 2, through to 2 + OUTPUT_SLOT_COUNT exclusive, will just try to move to player's inventory
            .forSlots(2, OUTPUT_SLOT_COUNT)
            .tryMoveToPlayer()
            .build();

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="configurable-hud"><a class="header" href="#configurable-hud">Configurable HUD</a></h1>
<p>Wanderers of the Rift has a system for defining HUD elements whose rendering location can be configured, including the possibility of rotating for
compatible elements.</p>
<h2 id="principals"><a class="header" href="#principals">Principals</a></h2>
<p>A HUD element is rendered relative to a <code>ScreenAnchor</code>. There are nine of these - one for each corner of the screen, one for the center of each
side of the screen, and one for the center of the screen. Being anchored means that regardless of the screen size the element should moved to maintain the
same offset from that anchor. For example, when you resize the screen the hotbar remains attached to the bottom-center of the screen.</p>
<p>To achieve this the size of the HUD element needs to be known - its width and height. This allows the correct top-left position to be determined.</p>
<p>For HUD elements that can grow or change sizes, this growth should ideally be "away" from the anchor. For example, when the player gains
additional hearts, they should appear in a new row above if anchored to the bottom of the screen, and a new row below if anchored to
the top of the screen.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-info"><a class="header" href="#configuration-info">Configuration Info</a></h2>
<p>Each HUD element has the following configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the element is visible</li>
<li>Where the element is anchored</li>
<li>The x,y offset of the HUD element in pixels. This is applied relative to where the element is anchored.</li>
<li>Optionally, the orientation of the element if rotation is supported.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage-2"><a class="header" href="#usage-2">Usage</a></h2>
<h3 id="adapting-an-existing-hud-element"><a class="header" href="#adapting-an-existing-hud-element">Adapting an existing HUD element</a></h3>
<p>For use with vanilla or HUD elements from other mods.</p>
<p>In ClientConfig, add a <code>HudElementConfig</code> for the HUD element - this will capture the player's configuration. Ensure the default values reflect
how the element is placed normally:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static final HudElementConfig EXPERIENCE_BAR;

static {
    // For example, minecraft experience bar is displayed relative to the bottom-center of the screen
    EXPERIENCE_BAR = new HudElementConfig.Builder("Vanilla Experience Bar", "xpBar")
            .anchor(ScreenAnchor.BOTTOM_CENTER)
            .offset(0, -24)
            // If not specified, the element cannot be rotated
            .rotates(UIOrientation.HORIZONTAL)
            .build(builder);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next register a ConfigurableLayerAdapter for the element - this will intercept the rendering of element and reposition (and optionally rotate) it based
on the configuration. A basic fixed size adapter is provided to handle basic HUD elements - this requires knowing the maximum width and height of the element.
A separate DeferredRegister should be used for vanilla and each mod.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static final DeferredRegister&lt;ConfigurableLayer&gt; VANILLA_LAYERS = DeferredRegister
        .create(WotrClientRegistries.Keys.CONFIGURABLE_LAYERS, "minecraft");

public static final Supplier&lt;ConfigurableLayerAdapter&gt; VANILLA_XP_BAR = VANILLA_LAYERS.register(
            VanillaGuiLayers.EXPERIENCE_BAR.getPath(),
            () -&gt; new FixedSizeLayerAdapter(Component.translatable("hud.minecraft.experience_bar"), ClientConfig.EXPERIENCE_BAR, 182, 5, List.of(VanillaGuiLayers.EXPERIENCE_BAR)));
</code></pre>
<p>For more advanced handling a custom adapter can be created by implementing <code>ConfigurableLayerAdapter</code>. This provides access to <code>preRender</code>, <code>render</code>, and <code>postRender</code> for the layer.
This can be used to manipulate the poseStack to reposition and rotate the existing layer when it is rendered. Do take care to undo any transformations made in <code>preRender</code>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-native-configurable-hud-element"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-native-configurable-hud-element">Creating a native configurable HUD element</a></h3>
<p>First, once more will need to add a <code>HudElementConfig</code> for the new HUD element:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static final HudElementConfig MANA_BAR;

static {
MANA_BAR = new HudElementConfig.Builder("Mana Bar", "manaBar").anchor(ScreenAnchor.TOP_LEFT)
                .offset(25, 0)
                // Optional, if rotates is not specified then the HUD element will not be rotatable
                .rotates(UIOrientation.VERTICAL)
                .build(builder);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The HUD element itself should implement <code>ConfigurableLayer</code> - this requires implementing four methods. These are used primarily
by the configuration UI.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class ManaBar implements ConfigurableLayer {
    /**

<p>Beyond this, when rendering the element should use the config to determine where it should render:</p>

public void render(@NotNull GuiGraphics guiGraphics, @NotNull DeltaTracker deltaTracker) {
    // General check for whether to render the element, including a getConfig().isVisible check.
    Minecraft minecraft = Minecraft.getInstance();

            || minecraft.gameMode.getPlayerMode() == GameType.SPECTATOR) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Determine the width and height of the element. This may need information about the player or state of the game
    int width = calcWidth();
    int height = calcHeight();
    
    // Top-left screen pos to render the element in
    Vector2i pos = getConfig().getPosition(width, height, guiGraphics.guiWidth(), guiGraphics.guiHeight());
    // Other config settings such as orientation can be used to determine how to render too.
    UIOrientation orientation = getConfig().getOrientation();
}
</code></pre>
<p>The HUD element should be registered as a configurable layer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class ModConfigurableLayers {
    public static final DeferredRegister&lt;ConfigurableLayer&gt; LAYERS = DeferredRegister
            .create(WotrClientRegistries.Keys.CONFIGURABLE_LAYERS, Mod.MODID);

    public static final Supplier&lt;ConfigurableLayer&gt; MANA_BAR = LAYERS.register("mana_bar", ManaBar::new);
}
</code></pre>
<p>and should also be registered as a GuiLayer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@EventBusSubscriber(modid = Mod.MODID, bus = EventBusSubscriber.Bus.MOD, value = Dist.CLIENT)
public class ModGuiLayers {
    public static final ResourceLocation MANA_BAR = ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath(Mod.MODID, "mana_bar");

<p>Welcome to the Code Decisions Page. This is where you can find all the code decisions for the Wanderers of the Rift Mod(Pack).</p>

<p>This page is for the implementation of the design. It will contain the specific code pointers for the individual design pieces described in <a href="code/design/../../design/DesignDocHome.html">Design</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p>This guideline will more than likely grow a lot as we make more progress. After an internal overview and discussions, we have gathered quite a few things to help us give everyone a bit more of some art direction and guidelines to help us move art a bit forward.</p>
<h1 id="guidelines"><a class="header" href="#guidelines">Guidelines</a></h1>
<h4 id="16-x-16-pixel-ratio-for-all-the-artwork"><a class="header" href="#16-x-16-pixel-ratio-for-all-the-artwork">16 x 16 pixel ratio for all the artwork</a></h4>
<h4 id="stay-within-the-realm-of-minecraft-style"><a class="header" href="#stay-within-the-realm-of-minecraft-style">Stay within the realm of Minecraft style</a></h4>
<h4 id="iconssprites-have-a-darkened-border-around-them"><a class="header" href="#iconssprites-have-a-darkened-border-around-them">Icons/sprites have a darkened border around them</a></h4>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/border.png" alt="border" /></p>
<p>We should try to always keep this style aspect because it's what makes items look like they are in a Minecraft style. The amount of how dark a border is can be subjective, but I would refrain from using pure black.
Many may not realize but even the darker border follows shading/lighting where the bottom sides are often darker to give a shadow effect.</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/border-shading.png" alt="border shading" /></p>
<p>And it can be subtle or even a bit more contrasting.
A Minecraft item slot in almost all GUI containers like the inventory are all 16x160</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/item-slot.png" alt="item slot" /></p>
<p>As much as humanly possible we should strive to always keep a 1px space between items and the border of the 16x16 box</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/margin.png" alt="margin" /></p>
<p>Sometimes this is not always possible, but we should try to keep it this way as much as we possibly can. Here is an example of how it sometimes does not:</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/margin-exception.png" alt="margin exception" /></p>
<p>It's okay if small parts sometimes touch the edges, just try to refrain from having things touch edges as much as possible.
(This only applies to items that will be in inventory - this does not apply to icons like abilities)</p>
<h4 id="icons-should-be-fairly-simplified-but-this-does-not-mean-that-they-should-be-flat-or-boring"><a class="header" href="#icons-should-be-fairly-simplified-but-this-does-not-mean-that-they-should-be-flat-or-boring">Icons should be fairly simplified, but this does not mean that they should be flat or boring</a></h4>
<p>This means that you should really try to simplify your drawing/idea as much as you can while still being able to convey what it is clearly to the audience.
If you make very over-complicated icons, the details can get lost or blend together when small - making it hard or impossible for viewers to understand what the item is.</p>

<h1 id="art-style-direction"><a class="header" href="#art-style-direction">Art Style Direction</a></h1>
<p>After much discussion we have found some example of art and art style references that really give off the quality and standard of work we are really hoping for when it comes to creating art for this project. Of course we all want this project to look amazing so we have something we can be proud of and people really enjoy. To do this we really need to focus on creating quality content. Here are some examples of other works that we feel really helps convey that level of quality we hope for.</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/workbenches.png" alt="workbenches" /></p>
<p>Clean and beautiful workbenches, they don't need to always be something like 2 blocks wide like this example, but these are a very good references for building other types of workstations and give good examples of how to follow the 16x16 pixel ratio as well as keeping things fairly simple and letting the texture do a lot of heavy lifting in most cases.
It also helps give a good reference on how to keep things within an understandable size reference. The size of things next to other items, and how big things should be in contrast to other items.
These 3D references from Cataclysm Mod are also very nice</p>
<div style="
	display:flex; 
	flex-flow:row wrap;
	justify-content: center;

	<img style="width:49.5%;margin:0.25%;"  src="art/style-guide/examples/cataclysm-bosses-4.png" alt="cataclysm bosses 4">
</div>
<p>The Cataclysm Mod also shows great examples of how to keep blocks, items and workbenches within a "theme" they have two separate themes here as an example between Nether themed and End themed</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/cataclysm-themes.png" alt="cataclysm themes" /></p>
<p>Here are some nice-looking item references also seen from the Occultism Mod</p>
<div style="
	display:flex; 
	flex-flow:row wrap;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
">
	<img style="width:49.5%;margin:0.25%;" src="art/style-guide/examples/occultism-items.png" alt="occultism items">
	<img style="width:49.5%;margin:0.25%;" src="art/style-guide/examples/occultism-thumbnail.png" alt="occultism thumbnail">
</div>
<p>When it comes to other blocks and 3D creations, it's really great to look at the Create Mod</p>
<div style="
	display:flex; 
	flex-flow:row wrap;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
">
	<img style="width:49.5%;margin:0.25%;" src="art/style-guide/examples/create-blocks.png" alt="create blocks">
	<img style="width:49.5%;margin:0.25%;" src="art/style-guide/examples/create-thumbnail.png" alt="create thumbnail">
</div>
<p>3D materials, workbenches, and blocks in Create also are a great example of keeping things simple and letting the texture do a lot of heavy lifting</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/create-color-schemes.png" alt="create color schemes" /></p>
<p>Create is also a great example of how to follow color schemes and color pallets when creating variations and items that combine main materials like the metals in this example
You want to follow the color schemes of specific themes and keep it very close to the actual colors used to keep consistency and make it understandable that these things are related somehow, and we do that by keeping the color schemes consistent visually
Create also often incorporates many default minecraft textures as well - making it so their items also match with vanilla minecraft blocks like the spruce and dark oak wood. This is really nice to do sometimes and can help tie blocks into other minecraft blocks for people who love to build and need blocks that match but have variations</p>
<p>Here is a great example of keeping a color scheme across materials and items from the Enlightened Mod</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/enlightened-mod-color-schemes-1.png" alt="enlightened mod color schemes 1" /></p>
<p>The nuggets, ingots, blocks, weapons and armor all follow a very set color theme and execute it well
This mod is also further a wonderful example of following color schemes</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/enlightened-mod-color-schemes-2.png" alt="enlightened mod color schemes 2" /></p>
<p>When it comes to blocks, block-states and other building items and blocks
Blocks and items that follow a theme should stay very consistent when creating other variations to match with that theme</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/enlightened-mod-color-schemes-3.png" alt="enlightened mod color schemes 3" /></p>
<p>So when we create our color schemes and palettes we should strive to follow it as best we can
Other great examples and references for keeping with a specific style and color scheme is something like this from Ars Nouveau mod</p>
<div style="
	display:flex; 
	flex-flow:row wrap;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
">
	<img style="width:49.5%;margin:0.25%;" src="art/style-guide/examples/ars-nouveau-1.png" alt="ars nouveau 1">
	<img style="width:49.5%;margin:0.25%;" src="art/style-guide/examples/ars-nouveau-2.png" alt="ars nouveau 2">
</div>
<p>This is another example similar to the Create Mod how you can keep 3D objects, blocks, items, and other things within a very tidy and clean color scheme/theme
These all have a very specific Purple + Gold color scheme and all the objects follow the same style theme with the square-ish swirled corners and details
Always using the gold as this structural metal accent and the purple always being this other more stone-like material
Its a great way to keep a visual consistency - keeping some of the details on the objects similar in color and style to create a style consistency</p>
<h4 id="some-items-may-break-some-rules"><a class="header" href="#some-items-may-break-some-rules">Some items may break some rules</a></h4>
<p>like the dark outlines rules and those things are usually items like flowers</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/flowers-1.png" alt="flowers 1" /></p>
<p>Flowers and plants in Minecraft often break the rules of "dark outlines" and also the 1px space in the 16x16 frame
Not many other items break these rules, it's very few and far between.</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/flowers-2.png" alt="flowers 2" /></p>
<p>This is because of how the image is used to make the actual "3D" plant/flower
Where the image is usually criss-cross in an X formation like this</p>
<div style="
	display:flex; 
	flex-flow:row wrap;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
">
	<img style="width:69.5%;margin:0.25%;" src="art/style-guide/examples/flowers-3.png" alt="flowers 3">
	<img style="width:29.5%;margin:0.25%;" src="art/style-guide/examples/flowers-4.png" alt="flowers 4">
</div>
<p>Here is more references to items that follow a color scheme/theme wonderfully from the Deeper and Darker mod</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/deeper-and-darker-1.png" alt="deeper and darker 1" /></p>
<p>These items are also well made and another example of how to follow the rules of the darker borders + 1px space</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/deeper-and-darker-2.png" alt="deeper and darker 2" /></p>
<p>Creating a color palette of blues and greens with this cream/bone-like color as secondary color and the bright cyan as an accent color
So when we have a theme that has a color palette like this:</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/deeper-and-darker-3.png" alt="deeper and darker 3" /></p>
<p>We want to follow it - and execute it - in a very similar fashion/way</p>
<h1 id="exporting-items"><a class="header" href="#exporting-items">Exporting Items</a></h1>
<p>The best way to export items is to make sure you export the item inside and with the artboard size. 16 pixels x 16 pixels</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/export-size.png" alt="export size" /></p>
<p>Items should be exported with a transparent background as a .png</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/transparent-bg.png" alt="transparent background" /></p>
<p><img src="https://discord.com/assets/fb6fd920c79bd504.svg" alt="⚠️" /> Opacity on items doesn't work the way you want it to
You cannot have semi-see-through colors with a low opacity on items
that low-opacity spot will render full opacity
This is why its really important to clean up your icons from any stray very very low opacity pixels - they will show up when rendered
Especially in the areas you want to be transparent</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/opacity.png" alt="opacity" /></p>
<p>you care barely see it here, but this stray very low opacity pixel WILL show up in full solid opacity when its loaded in the game</p>
<h1 id="color-schemes"><a class="header" href="#color-schemes">Color Schemes</a></h1>
<p>I would say its best to look for color combinations that work really well together and offer something possibly unique or help match other existing blocks or vanilla blocks</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/palettes-1.png" alt="palettes 1" /></p>
<p>This website can help you pick colors and their different complimentary colors like color Triads, Tetrads, and Adjacent colors
You can also find other generators like these online as well
https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/
Canva also has a library of nice color palletes</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/palettes-2.png" alt="palettes 2" /></p>
<p>But there are also a lot more websites online that offer color palettes as well one that I love to use often is https://www.colourlovers.com/
when creating a color palette is is best to also include the colors Hex codes as well</p>
<div style="
	display:flex; 
	flex-flow:row wrap;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
">
	<img style="width:49.5%;margin:0.25%;" src="art/style-guide/examples/palettes-3.png" alt="palettes 3">
	<img style="width:49.5%;margin:0.25%;" src="art/style-guide/examples/palettes-4.png" alt="palettes 4">
</div>
<p>But we should always keep in mind to pick color schemes that actually <em>work</em> well within our project and compare them next to other items and blocks that we have
Sometimes it's wonderful to create some colors or color variations that our pack or minecraft does not offer as well
But overall you need to be sure that it still "works" with other blocks and can be used (for the most part)
Here is an example of that from my artboard where I was working on blocks for the Vault God - themed blocks</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/block-palettes-1.png" alt="block palettes 1" />
<img src="art/style-guide/examples/block-palettes-2.png" alt="block palettes 2" /></p>
<p>The blue section are the new blocks and the red section are the minecraft colors and blocks there as a reference
But you can see that darker green wood that doesn't exist in minecraft or that pack
It was something new, but it still worked well with the color scheme and provided a new block and color for builders to work with
I'll show also another exampe from another artboard where I made many new block colors</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/block-palettes-3.png" alt="block palettes 3" /></p>
<p>Here are some examples of really great food items to use as a reference when making food or crop items</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/food-1.png" alt="food 1" /></p>
<p>This example is from the Croptopia Mod</p>
<img src="art/style-guide/examples/food-2.png" alt="food 2" width="50%">
<p>Notice how they are so simple but really get the main idea across?</p>
<h1 id="checking-items-against-minecraft-grey"><a class="header" href="#checking-items-against-minecraft-grey">Checking Items Against Minecraft Grey</a></h1>
<p>It's really important to check if your art assets work well against minecraft grey like in the inventory and hotbars</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/minecraft-grey.png" alt="minecraft grey" /></p>
<p>You might make an item that looks really cool but once you test it against the background of minecraft grey parts of it could vanish or not have enough contrast to stand out correctly in the inventory
It's best to work with that grey as your "paper color" or "background color" while working to help you see if your art has enough contrast against minecraft grey
<strong>Minecraft grey hex code is around:</strong> #8b8b8b</p>
<h1 id="creating-minecraft-mcmeta-animations"><a class="header" href="#creating-minecraft-mcmeta-animations">Creating Minecraft MCmeta Animations</a></h1>
<p>Minecraft animation on most items and block textures are done using MCmeta files and the code that tells minecraft how to run the animation.
the picture files are made creating a long strip of 16x16 frames</p>
<img width="50%" src="art/style-guide/examples/animated-textures-1.png" alt="animated textures 1">
<p>So your height of your document will also be in multiples of 16
Minecraft frames ALWAYS start with Zero 0 as the number for the first frame</p>
<img width="50%" src="art/style-guide/examples/animated-textures-2.png" alt="animated textures 2">
<p>The frame strip is saved as a .png as normal</p>
<img width="50%" src="art/style-guide/examples/animated-textures-3.png" alt="animated textures 3">
<p>But there is also a basic notepad document that goes with it
That is the MCmeta file that contains the information on how the animation should go
And the name of the file always contains the FULL name of the image it's connected to
Here you can see the PNG's name is "chromatic_steel_ingot.png"
And the MC Meta file's name is "chromatic_steel_ingot.png.mcmeta"</p>
<img width="50%" src="art/style-guide/examples/animated-textures-4.png" alt="animated textures 4">
<p>This is an example of the MCmeta code
It's pretty simple
As you can see it is telling minecraft that this animation takes the frames in this order 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,6,5,4,3,2,1
So it basically... goes down the strip, and then goes back up the strip</p>
<img width="50%" src="art/style-guide/examples/animated-textures-5.png" alt="animated textures 5">
<p>You don't have to write the zero 0 at the end because the process will start again at zero 0 (so adding it to the end is a bit redundant)
The "Frametime" is just how fast the frames go/how many ticks
And the "Interpolation" is if you want the frames to gradually fade from one to the next or not
Here it is set to "True" which means that the frames do gradually fade from one to the next
Setting it to "False" would make them blink quickly between each frame very sharply
This can be helpful when you are making something like a blinking light on a something electrical
Your MCmeta file needs to follow this code layout to work correctly</p>
<p><img src="https://discord.com/assets/fb6fd920c79bd504.svg" alt="⚠️" /> A COMMON MISTAKE
People make is that at the end of the frame list they accidently add a comma ( , ) at the end of their frame list and this will mess up your animation from working.</p>
<img width="50%" src="art/style-guide/examples/animated-textures-6.png" alt="animated textures 6">
<p>the last frame in the list does not need a comma, if you add one it will not work
There are other cool things to do with animation and MCmeta code, you can find those online with a quick google search
And this is an example of how it works, and what it means, but there are many ways to write the frames to give awesome effects</p>
<h1 id="design-inspo-based-on-recipes"><a class="header" href="#design-inspo-based-on-recipes">Design Inspo Based On Recipes</a></h1>
<p>So, I was talking about this earlier in another thread and its a good thing to also mention here as well
Lets say you are making a new 3D design or an item, somethin that can be helpful when making an item is to look at the items in the recipe that create it (if applicable)</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/cataclysm-anvil-1.png" alt="cataclysm anvil 1" /></p>
<p>Taking this anvil as an example - from the Cataclysm mod
It has these reds and oranges and greys in its texture design
which is influenced on its recipe components</p>
<p><img src="art/style-guide/examples/cataclysm-anvil-2.png" alt="cataclysm anvil 2" /></p>
<p>The red from the redstone blocks, and the orange and red "veins" on the ingots
This is another way to create things in a way/fashion that helps keep within a theme as well</p>

<p>The Hub is a <strong>thriving metropolis</strong></p>
<p>Construct where civilizations, curious scholars, ambitious traders, and skilled artisans have established permanent operations. Part research university, part commercial district, part diplomatic embassy, and part exclusive club for those who can navigate multiple realities.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-hub-exists-here"><a class="header" href="#why-the-hub-exists-here">Why the Hub Exists Here</a></h2>
<p>The Hub exists because <strong>incredible potential</strong></p>
<p>Far from being an accident the Hub was likely established by entities who understood that the convergence creates opportunities. Advancement, discovery, and prosperity. The location was chosen specifically for its strategic advantages in accessing multiple dimensions and neutral location.</p>
<h2 id="the-physical-form"><a class="header" href="#the-physical-form">The Physical Form</a></h2>
<p>The Hub is <strong>an elegant collection of interconnected platforms and spires</strong></p>
<p>Floating in empty space that serves as a neutral meeting ground between dimensions. The architecture is a deliberate fusion of the finest design principles from multiple realities:</p>
<h3 id="grand-central"><a class="header" href="#grand-central">Grand Central</a></h3>
<p>A massive crystalline dome where representatives from different guilds and species conduct daily business. The space is adapted to accommodate the needs of various atmospheric/gravitational requirements, with sections that can simulate different environmental conditions for different visitors.</p>
<h3 id="prosperity-1"><a class="header" href="#prosperity-1">Prosperity</a></h3>
<p>Elegant quarters where successful guild operations establish their primary facilities. Purpose-built installations that rival the finest institutions in any single reality. Each district showcases the pinnacle of achievement from their respective fields.</p>
<h3 id="innovation"><a class="header" href="#innovation">Innovation</a></h3>
<p>State-of-the-art facilities where the most advanced minds from multiple realities collaborate on projects impossible in any single dimension. Technology of interdimensional science and craft.</p>
<h3 id="cultural"><a class="header" href="#cultural">Cultural</a></h3>
<p>Different civilizations showcase their finest achievements. Nostalgia/embassy. Proud displays of ongoing cultural excellence and exchange.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-space-grows"><a class="header" href="#how-the-space-grows">How the Space Grows</a></h2>
<p>The Hub expands through <strong>strategic planning and successful ventures</strong>.</p>
<p>Growth is intentional. Master plans developed by interdimensional architects and city planners.</p>
<p>Expansion patterns include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investment Growth</strong>: New sections are funded and built when ventures prove profitable enough to warrant expansion</li>
<li><strong>Diplomatic Growth</strong>: Additional embassy quarters are constructed as new civilizations seek representation</li>
<li><strong>Academic Growth</strong>: Research facilities expand as new fields of study prove fruitful</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Growth</strong>: Market districts develop as trade relationships mature and new opportunities emerge</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-inhabitants-as-contributors"><a class="header" href="#the-inhabitants-as-contributors">The Inhabitants as Contributors</a></h2>
<p>The residents don't just grow the Hub <strong>they actively design and develop it</strong>.</p>
<p>These are accomplished beings who chose to relocate here because of the unique opportunities the Hub provides. They bring their expertise, resources, and ambitions to bear in creating something greater than any single reality could achieve.</p>
<p>Long-term residents often become civic leaders, department heads, or district coordinators. They thrive and expand across multiple realities simultaneously.</p>
<h2 id="surrounding-environment"><a class="header" href="#surrounding-environment">Surrounding Environment</a></h2>
<p>The Hub exists at <strong>the most advantageous intersection of dimensions</strong></p>
<p>A location that provides optimal access to the greatest variety of dimensions with the least dimensional turbulence. It's the prime real estate that sophisticated entities compete to access.</p>
<p>The surrounding space isn't empty void but rather a carefully maintained neutral zone where different physical laws can coexist without interference. The "sky" here shows carefully curated views of various realities, serving both as navigation aids and as an ever-changing gallery of cosmic beauty.</p>
<h2 id="the-rifts"><a class="header" href="#the-rifts">The Rifts</a></h2>
<p>The rifts are <strong>precisely engineered gateway systems</strong>. Their purpose reflected in their design.</p>

<h3 id="the-productive-cycles"><a class="header" href="#the-productive-cycles">The Productive Cycles</a></h3>
<p>Time in the Hub follows efficient schedules coordinated across multiple dimensional time streams/zones. Different districts operate on optimized cycles that allow for maximum productivity and collaboration while respecting the various temporal preferences of different species and civilizations.</p>
<h3 id="the-confrence"><a class="header" href="#the-confrence">The Confrence</a></h3>
<p>Regular gatherings where guild leaders, dimensional ambassadors, and research heads share discoveries, negotiate deals, and plan collaborative ventures. Where minds from multiple realities conduct business.</p>
<h3 id="the-sessions"><a class="header" href="#the-sessions">The Sessions</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled periods where interdisciplinary teams work on breakthrough projects that combine knowledge and techniques from multiple realities. These sessions often result in patents, publications, and profitable new technologies.</p>
<h3 id="the-exchange"><a class="header" href="#the-exchange">The Exchange</a></h3>
<p>Social events where different civilizations share their finest achievements. Cuisine prepared by master chefs, performances by renowned artists, demonstrations by expert craftspeople. These are celebrations of excellence and sophistication.</p>
<h3 id="the-markets"><a class="header" href="#the-markets">The Markets</a></h3>
<p>Bustling commercial periods where rare goods, unique services, and valuable knowledge are traded. The Hub serves as the premier marketplace for items and information that simply cannot be found anywhere else.</p>
<h2 id="the-advantage"><a class="header" href="#the-advantage">The Advantage</a></h2>
<p>Living in the Hub provides inhabitants with unparalleled access to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowledge</strong>: Information from multiple realities that provides massive strategic advantages</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong>: Materials and technologies that are common in one reality but revolutionary in another</li>
<li><strong>Networks</strong>: Professional and social connections spanning multiple dimensions</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities</strong>: Business ventures and research projects possible only through interdimensional collaboration</li>

<h2 id="what-the-hub-represents-1"><a class="header" href="#what-the-hub-represents-1">What the Hub Represents</a></h2>
<p>The Hub represents <strong>sanctuary in chaos</strong></p>
<p>Where beings from shattered realities have found refuge and purpose. Not just a waystation, humanity's (and other beings') attempt to create meaning and community in the face of infinite uncertainty. Adaptation, collaboration, and the fundamental need for connection when everything familiar has been lost or changed.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-hub-is-1"><a class="header" href="#what-this-hub-is-1">What This Hub Is</a></h2>
<p>The Hub is a <strong>living archive of survivors</strong></p>
<p>Grown organically around the phenomenon of dimensional displacement. Started as emergency shelter but has evolved into something between a monastery, a research station, and a frontier town. Its inhabitants are the refugees, scholars, traders, and wanderers who have made this impossible place their home.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-hub-exists-here-1"><a class="header" href="#why-the-hub-exists-here-1">Why the Hub Exists Here</a></h2>
<p>The Hub exists because <strong>reality broke and someone had to sweep up the pieces</strong></p>
<p>Displaced beings needed somewhere to go. Somewhere stable enough to rest, plan, and understand what was happening. The Hub formed naturally: the eye of the storm. The one place where the chaos/instability is temporarily held at bay.</p>
<h2 id="the-physical-form-1"><a class="header" href="#the-physical-form-1">The Physical Form</a></h2>
<p>The Hub takes the form of <strong>a collection of floating islands suspended in a void</strong> (eternal twilight)</p>
<p>Connected by bridges of crystallized starlight and tethered by chains of woven dimensional fabric. Each island represents a different approach to survival and understanding:</p>
<h3 id="the-spire"><a class="header" href="#the-spire">The Spire</a></h3>
<p>A towering structure of unknown origin that seems to grow from the void itself. Part observatory, part lighthouse, part shrine. Pulses with a gentle rhythm that keeps the other islands stable. The &lt;Guild?&gt; maintains their vigil here, watching the cosmic dance of realities through crystalline windows that show not just what is but what could be.</p>
<h3 id="the-garden"><a class="header" href="#the-garden">The Garden</a></h3>
<p>Lush islands where displaced ecosystems have taken root. Plants from a dozen different realities grow in impossible harmony. Tended by beings who remember extinct worlds. The air here smells of rain from forgotten skies and flowers that bloomed in other stars' light.</p>
<h3 id="the-workshop"><a class="header" href="#the-workshop">The Workshop</a></h3>
<p>Islands of stone and metal where the sound of hammers rings through the void. Refugees who once were craftsmen have learned to forge alloys that don't exist in any single reality. Sparks from their anvils drift like fireflies through the darkness.</p>
<h3 id="the-vault"><a class="header" href="#the-vault">The Vault</a></h3>
<p>Quiet islands lined with structures that seem to shift and change when not directly observed. Scholars and archivists work here. Cataloging stories, technologies, and wisdom of displaced civilizations before they fade from memory entirely.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-space-grows-1"><a class="header" href="#how-the-space-grows-1">How the Space Grows</a></h2>
<p>The Hub expands through <strong>organic necessity and collective will</strong></p>
<p>When new groups of displaced beings arrive the void itself seems to respond to their need. New islands crystallize from nothing. Shaped by the memories and hopes of their inhabitants.</p>
<p>The expansion follows patterns/stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crisis</strong>: When major dimensional catastrophes occur emergency platforms appear almost instantly</li>
<li><strong>Cultural</strong>: As communities establish themselves their shared identity manifests as architectural style and environmental changes</li>
<li><strong>Connective</strong>: New bridges and pathways form as relationships develop between different groups</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-inhabitants-as-builders"><a class="header" href="#the-inhabitants-as-builders">The Inhabitants as Builders</a></h2>
<p>The survivors <strong>become part of it</strong></p>
<p>Their very presence beginning to influence their surroundings. A librarian's quarters might generate shelves, while a gardener's island becomes more fertile. The Hub responds to genuine need and authentic purpose.</p>
<p>Some inhabitants never leave their chosen islands becoming almost symbiotic with their domains. Others serve as bridges between communities. Their own nature adapting to help facilitate understanding and cooperation.</p>
<h2 id="surrounding-environment-1"><a class="header" href="#surrounding-environment-1">Surrounding Environment</a></h2>
<p>The Hub exists <strong>in the interstitial space between realities</strong></p>
<p>Not quite in any dimension but touching all of them. It occupies the pause between heartbeats of the cosmos. The silence between sentences in the multiverse novel. From here inhabitants can observe the dimensions without being swept away.</p>
<p>Hopeful residents see the void around the Hub not as empty but filled with possibility. Often speak of glimpsing shapes in the darkness they believe as potential worlds that might be, memories of realities that were, or dreams of dimensions that could still come to pass.</p>
<h2 id="the-rifts-1"><a class="header" href="#the-rifts-1">The Rifts</a></h2>
<p>The rifts themselves appear as tears in the air at the edges of various islands. Each one surrounded by appropriate ceremonial architecture developed by the communities that use them most:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observatory</strong>: Surrounded by rotating orreries and star charts where departures are calculated and recorded</li>
<li><strong>Forge</strong>: Set within a great circular hearth where weapons and tools are blessed before journeys</li>
<li><strong>Archive</strong>: Flanked by towering stone tablets recording the names of all who have passed through</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="eternal-twilight"><a class="header" href="#eternal-twilight">Eternal Twilight</a></h3>
<p>Time moves strangely here. Not mechanical tick of clocks. Organic rhythm of need and rest. The Hub exists in perpetual twilight with gentle auroras providing a slowly shifting light cycle that helps inhabitants maintain some semblance of routine.</p>
<h3 id="exchange"><a class="header" href="#exchange">Exchange</a></h3>
<p>Every "day" begins with the Great Exchange. Gathering where news from recent rift expeditions is shared, resources are distributed, and new arrivals are welcomed. Not only practical it's spiritual too. Daily affirmation that despite everything community persists.</p>
<h3 id="night"><a class="header" href="#night">Night</a></h3>
<p>As the aurora dims various groups maintain vigils. Watching for new rift formations. Tending to nocturnal plants from shadow-worlds. Maintaining the dimensional anchors that keep the Hub stable.</p>

<p>Shared dining experiences. Inhabitants recreate foods from their lost worlds. Sharing stories and flavors that keep dead realities alive in small but meaningful ways.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-hub-represents-2"><a class="header" href="#what-the-hub-represents-2">What the Hub Represents</a></h2>
<p>The Hub represents <strong>possibility through diversity</strong></p>
<p>A place where beings from countless realities have come together for myriad reasons and created something unprecedented. A living example of how different forms of life, knowledge, and purpose can coexist and enhance each other. The Hub embodies the principle that great things happen when barriers come down and different perspectives meet.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-hub-is-2"><a class="header" href="#what-this-hub-is-2">What This Hub Is</a></h2>
<p>The Hub is a <strong>vibrant interdimensional community</strong></p>
<p>Refugee camps neighbor research institutes, emergency shelters have evolved into cultural districts, and scholars work alongside street-smart survivors. Sanctuary, marketplace, university, embassy; mixture that defies simple categorization because its inhabitants defy simple categorization.
(Melting pot)</p>
<h2 id="why-the-hub-exists-here-2"><a class="header" href="#why-the-hub-exists-here-2">Why the Hub Exists Here</a></h2>
<p><strong>Convergence creates both crisis and opportunity simultaneously</strong></p>
<p>Some beings were displaced against their will while others saw unprecedented chances for exploration and advancement. A point where both groups' needs could be met. Safety and stability, while adventurers and scholars found access to infinite new frontiers.</p>
<h2 id="the-physical-form-2"><a class="header" href="#the-physical-form-2">The Physical Form</a></h2>
<p>The Hub takes the form of <strong>interconnected districts that have grown organically around a central anchor point</strong></p>
<p>Suspended in a realm where multiple dimensional influences create a unique and ever evolving environment. The architecture tells the story of its diverse inhabitants:</p>
<h3 id="foundation"><a class="header" href="#foundation">Foundation</a></h3>
<p>The oldest section, built around emergency shelters and aid stations that have evolved into permanent institutions. Simple but sturdy structures house essential services. Medical facilities run by healers from a dozen realities, food distribution centers serving cuisine from forgotten worlds, and orientation centers where newcomers learn to navigate their new home.</p>
<h3 id="prosperity-2"><a class="header" href="#prosperity-2">Prosperity</a></h3>
<p>Elegant sections where successful ventures have established themselves. These might have started as refugee skills-sharing programs but have grown into thriving businesses, research institutions, and cultural centers. Success stories made manifest in architecture and atmosphere.</p>
<h3 id="innovation-1"><a class="header" href="#innovation-1">Innovation</a></h3>
<p>Collaborative spaces where necessity bred invention. Some of the Hub's greatest achievements came from refugees with nothing but knowledge working with entrepreneurs who had resources but lacked perspective. These districts showcase what happens when different forms of desperation and ambition combine.</p>
<h3 id="cultural-1"><a class="header" href="#cultural-1">Cultural</a></h3>
<p>Neighborhoods where different groups have recreated pieces of home. Partially to nostalgia, but also living, breathing communities. A district of crystal spires where energy beings have found new forms of expression sits next to terraced gardens where agricultural refugees have created the Hub's food security.</p>
<h3 id="commons"><a class="header" href="#commons">Commons</a></h3>
<p>Shared spaces where all inhabitants gather regardless of their origin or circumstances. Markets where a displaced farmer might trade vegetables with an interdimensional merchant, plazas where children from multiple realities play together, and forums where everyone has a voice in community decisions.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-space-grows-2"><a class="header" href="#how-the-space-grows-2">How the Space Grows</a></h2>
<p>The Hub expands through <strong>organic community development driven by both need and ambition</strong></p>
<p>Growth happens when:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crisis</strong>: Emergency expansions when new displaced populations arrive, often built quickly but with community support</li>
<li><strong>Investment</strong>: Prosperity districts expand when ventures prove profitable and beneficial to the wider community</li>
<li><strong>Culture</strong>: New neighborhoods emerge as established groups want to celebrate their heritage or explore new cultural fusions</li>
<li><strong>Collaboraton</strong>: Shared spaces develop when different groups discover mutual interests or complementary skills</li>
<li><strong>Innovation</strong>: Research and workshop areas expand when breakthrough discoveries require new facilities</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-inhabitants-as-community-builders"><a class="header" href="#the-inhabitants-as-community-builders">The Inhabitants as Community Builders</a></h2>
<p>The residents shape the Hub through <strong>active participation in a truly democratic community</strong></p>
<p>Regradless of background (refugee, entrepreneur, scholar, wanderer, or something else entirely)
inhabitants contribute according to their abilities and needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Survivor</strong> bring resilience, practical skills, and streetsmart wisdom about adaptation</li>
<li><strong>Entrepreneur</strong> provide resources, innovation, and economic opportunities</li>
<li><strong>Scholar</strong> offer knowledge, research capabilities, and long term planning</li>
<li><strong>Artisan</strong> create beauty, functional goods, and cultural bridges between different groups</li>
<li><strong>Diplomat</strong> facilitate communication and resolve conflicts between diverse populations</li>
<li><strong>Dreamer</strong> envision possibilities that others might never consider</li>
</ul>
<p>The longer a resident lives in the hub the more their role changes/evolves. A refugee might become a successful trader, a scholar might become a community leader, or an entrepreneur might dedicate themselves to humanitarian work.</p>
<h2 id="surrounding-environment-2"><a class="header" href="#surrounding-environment-2">Surrounding Environment</a></h2>
<p>The Hub exists as <strong>a natural meeting point between realities</strong></p>
<p>Not the most advantageous location for any single group, but the most accessible and stable for the greatest variety of beings. This democratic accessibility is part of what makes the community work. No single faction controls the location's advantages.</p>
<p>The surrounding interdimensional space reflects the community's diversity. Some areas show the ordered beauty of advanced civilizations, others the wild beauty of untamed realities, and still others the strange new aesthetics that emerge when different physical laws intersect.</p>
<h2 id="the-rifts-2"><a class="header" href="#the-rifts-2">The Rifts</a></h2>
<p>The rifts are <strong>maintained through collaborative effort</strong> using a combination of the talents and needs of the community.</p>

<h3 id="work-day"><a class="header" href="#work-day">Work (day)</a></h3>
<p>Different districts operate on schedules that accommodate their inhabitants' needs and origins. Some areas buzz with high-energy commerce and research, others follow more contemplative rhythms, and emergency services operate continuously. The diversity of schedules creates a community that's always alive but never frantic.</p>
<h3 id="mix-evening"><a class="header" href="#mix-evening">Mix (evening)</a></h3>
<p>Regular social periods where barriers between districts soften. Formal business gives way to informal collaboration, cultural exchange, and simple friendship. A refugee teaching survival skills to a scholar's children, an entrepreneur funding a refugee's business idea, a artist creating a mural that tells everyone's story.</p>
<h3 id="tradition-night"><a class="header" href="#tradition-night">Tradition (night)</a></h3>
<p>Different groups maintain their own evening traditions. Spiritual practices, continued research, cultural celebration. The Hub's diversity means there's always something happening somewhere, but also always quiet spaces for those who need them.</p>
<h3 id="response"><a class="header" href="#response">Response</a></h3>
<p>When emergencies arise (new refugee arrivals, dimensional instabilities, or resource shortages) The entire community mobilizes. Successful enterprises provide resources, scholars offer expertise, survivors provide practical knowledge, and everyone contributes what they can.</p>
<h2 id="the-hubs-greatest-achievement"><a class="header" href="#the-hubs-greatest-achievement">The Hub's Greatest Achievement</a></h2>
<p>The Hub's success isn't measured in wealth or power, but in <strong>proving that diversity creates strength</strong>. Refugee's survival skills might solve a scholar's research problem, an entrepreneur's resources might fund a refugee's innovation, and a artist's vision might bridge cultural gaps that diplomats couldn't cross.
In any true community, people arrive for different reasons, bring different capabilities, and pursue different goals. They create something together that none could achieve alone.</p>

<p>Where walls, paths and floors comprise the bulk of the room.</p>
<p>Alt wall can be used for etching, and indicators like cracks.
Dark floor can be used in corners, further away from the path.
Planks will (almost) always be planks, for things like bridges.
Bricks can be used to indicate a more solid part.</p>
<p>Use these when making builds, both rooms and POIs, so the processors can easily target them.
<img src="builds/processor_blocks.png" alt="processor_blocks" /></p>
<p>Water can be used in the build as the themed liquid.</p>
<p>The other processor blocks can be used, but require a custom processor from the builder, and will be room specific, eg. a tree always needing logs.</p>
<h2 id="room-sizes"><a class="header" href="#room-sizes">Room Sizes</a></h2>
<p>The size of a room is indicated with a multiple of the gridlenght, being 15. The number between brackets indicates the fixed multiplier, in X, Y and Z direction, respectively.</p>
<p>Stable (3x3x3), standard room near the start, 47 blocks in every direction, and all doors easely reachable.<br />
Unstable (3xYx3), doors are not easely reachable anymore, and is used as a step between Stable and Chaos).<br />
Chaos (XxYxZ), doors are not in the center of a face anymore, has varying sizes, and makes the generated rift maze-like.</p>
<h2 id="room-builds"><a class="header" href="#room-builds">Room Builds</a></h2>
<p>All edges of the rooms need to be at least 3 blocks thick. This is not a hard rule, but try to have &gt;90% of the walls 3 blocks thick<br />
Leave spaces for POIs, which will be randomly generated on set positions. A jigsaw block needs to be placed in the center of the POI location.</p>
<p>Chaos rooms need 1/3 of their doors to remain open, with the jigsaw blocks inside them. Those doors need to be scattered around the room. The other doorways can be covered by processor blocks, but not by bedrock.</p>
<h2 id="room-naming"><a class="header" href="#room-naming">Room Naming</a></h2>
<p>The created room has to be saved using the following structure:<br />
<code>wotr:rift/room/stability/XYZ/roomname_x_signature</code> ,<br />
Where Stability is Stable, Unstable or Chaos, XYZ is the size in every direction (1, 2 or 3), and roomname is the name of the room, chosen by the builder, x is the variation number, signature is the builders signature.<br />
Example: <code>wotr:rift/room/stable/333/testRoom_1_builderName</code>.</p>
<h2 id="poi-sizes"><a class="header" href="#poi-sizes">POI sizes</a></h2>
<p>The POI sizes will be (X, Y, Z):<br />
(3, 3, 3)*, (5, 5, 5), (7, 6, 7), (9, 8, 9), (11, 9, 11)*.<br />
This is the outer size of the POI, not counting the floor layer.<br />
*Up for debate, might very well be removed.
As a current rule of thumb, place at least an equal amount of rift chest as the size of the PoI.
For example. In a 3,3,3 PoI place at least 3 chests.
No decision has been made yet on the generation of the chests but this allows for many future options, such as x% of the chests will be generated.</p>
<p>Additionally make sure that the PoI jigsaw block has been setup properly to allow for a clean replacement and or rotation.</p>

<p>The processors inputs a theme and a room, and turns the processor blocks in that room into the according blocks that the theme provides.<br />
The room is made from different processor blocks, that dictate the layout.<br />
The theme is a sort of dictionary, translating every processor block into several themed blocks, with a given weighting.<br />
For example: for cave theme, <code>processor_block_1</code> turns into 80% stone, 20% andesite. For wood theme, <code>processor_block_1</code> turns into 60% oak planks, 20% birch planks, 20% dark oak planks.</p>
<p>Themes are WIP</p>
<h2 id="fixed-and-extra-processor-blocks"><a class="header" href="#fixed-and-extra-processor-blocks">Fixed and Extra Processor blocks</a></h2>
<p>Processor blocks 1 through 7 are fixed, every theme can replace them.<br />
Processor blocks 8 through 14 are extra, not fixed, and a seperate processor has to be provided, specific to that room. That processor runs along additionally to the standard processor, so both pools can be used.<br />
Additional processors can be re-used, so multiple rooms can use the same additional processor. This means that multiple rooms can have a demand for themed glass, for example, even though themed glass is not a fixed processor. The required additional processor has to be indicated in the "Extra processor blocks used" forum.</p>
<p>Correct notation is WIP</p>
<h2 id="more-processor-capabilities"><a class="header" href="#more-processor-capabilities">More Processor capabilities</a></h2>
<p>There are processors that can place flowers and mushrooms on the floor, cobweb and vines against the wall, and fill flower pots with a long list of flowers, and alike. They can run over a room on request, or be theme dependent. This means that they dont have to be placed by the builder.<br />
Sometimes, it may be useful to pick an extra processor block dedicated to eg. leaves, to be sure leaves are placed in a tree-top shape.<br />
When choosing a leave block, if a oak leaves was chosen, the theme will potentially change these to different themed leaves to match the theme.</p>

<p>To get started with building for WotR, first you need to download <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/download/windows/">Prims modloader</a>, and the builders <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1382748526915747870/1385345216709525587">modpack</a>.
After setting up Prism, click on "Add Instance", "Import", "Browse" and locate the Builders Modpack you've just downloaded.</p>
<p>Another great tool to download is the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1382748526915747870/1383070611403702284">resource pack</a>, which is used to indicate the status of your builds. Launch the Builders Mod, go to "Options", "Resource Packs", "Open Pack Folder" and place the resource pack .zip in here.
Make sure you enable it by pressing the arrow on the icon.</p>
<p>Before you can get on the Builders Server, file a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1382748526915747870/1385202486620454943">ticket</a> to get access, but offline building is also possible.
The last thing you need to do, is putting your Discord name and timezone in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1382748526915747870/1383009059590115398">Builders Sheet in this post</a>, and pick an unused signature. This sheet will be used throughout the tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-introduction-to-building"><a class="header" href="#chapter-2-introduction-to-building">Chapter 2: Introduction to building</a></h2>
<p>Before we can get started with building, we first need to cover the basics. It is also advised to follow a tutorial on the basics of both WorldEdit and Structure Blocks, but not required.</p>
<h3 id="rooms-and-pois"><a class="header" href="#rooms-and-pois">Rooms and POIs</a></h3>
<p>Rooms are the main structures the game is played in. This is what you travel through in a rift.<br />
POIs are the small structures inside rooms that contain loot and enemies.<br />
Those two are the main structures of the game, and will be randomly generated every time you open a rift.
There are several sizes for both of them. For POIs, which have a footprint of a square, we indicate that by the horizontal length.
The lenghts used are: 3,5,7,9, and 11.
For Rooms we do not use the length of a block to indicate size, but a multiple of 15 (and a bit), the details can be found in the Docs.
A (3x3x3) Room is 47 blocks long in X, Y and Z direction, respectively.</p>
<p>There are different varieties for both of them, lets start with Rooms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stable Rooms: Always 3x3x3, and well-reachable doors. You don't need to build or break, nor travel long distances, to reach all exits.
These rooms are the first encountered when opening a Rift.</li>
<li>Unstable Rooms: 3xYx3 Rooms, they have varying height. The doors are not always well-reachable, and they are found around Stable rooms.</li>
<li>Chaos Rooms: Varying sizes, between 1 and 3. Those rooms do not have doors in the center of the faces, but on multiple fixed possible places.
They are placed on the outside of the Rift.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also varieties of POIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free: Free standing POIs can be placed all over the floor.</li>
<li>In-Wall: POIs that fully carve into the wall, like a cave.</li>
<li>Halfway: POIs that are half insid- and half outside (rounded up) the wall.</li>
<li>Ceiling: Those POIs are placed on the ceiling of the rooms, like a chandelier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="structure-blocks-and-jigsaw-blocks"><a class="header" href="#structure-blocks-and-jigsaw-blocks">Structure blocks and Jigsaw blocks</a></h3>
<p>The created structures are saved using structure blocks. If you use the templates, those are provided. Do not forget to use them to save, however.
Jigsaw blocks are the blocks that make generation of Rooms and POIs possible. They are pre-configured too.</p>
<h3 id="processor-blocks-1"><a class="header" href="#processor-blocks-1">Processor blocks</a></h3>
<p>Processor blocks are the blocks we (mostly) use to create rooms and POIs. They will be themed with a processor every time they are generated in game. For example,
a processor block in a cave theme will turn into stone, but the same block in a forest theme will turn into wood. An example is shown below.<br />
<img src="builds/example_hall.png" alt="example_hall" width="50%"/></p>
<h3 id="guides-in-game"><a class="header" href="#guides-in-game">Guides in game</a></h3>
<p>At the spawn location of the build server, a few guides are placed that give examples of the things above, and empty templates
are provided. On singleplayer, you can use the command: <code>/spawnpiece wotr:guides/[guide]</code> to spawn in the guideline pieces. There is an example hallway, showing what the processor blocks do. There are also several palettes for processor blocks. You can copy-paste by control-middleclick on the structure block, so you can have one near your building area. There is also a jigsaw palette, and example placements included.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-building-and-rules"><a class="header" href="#chapter-3-building-and-rules">Chapter 3: Building and rules</a></h2>
<p>To get consistent and quality rooms, there are a few rules we agreed upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Naming: The created room has to be saved using the following structure:
<code>wotr:rift/room/stability/XYZ/main_feature-#-signature</code>.
Where Stability is Stable, Unstable or Chaos, XYZ is the size in every direction (1, 2 or 3), and mainfeature is the main feature of the room, chosen by the builder, # is the variation number, signature is the builders signature.
Example: wotr:rift/room/stable/333/testRoom_1_builderName.<br />
The created POI has to be saved as the following: <code>wotr:rift/poi/type/size/main_feature-#-signature</code>.<br />
Here, type is free, inwall, halfway or ceiling. Size is one of 3, 5, 7, 9 or 11.</li>
<li>Room surfaces: The surfaces of the Rooms need to be at least 3 blocks thick. This is to prevent a casual player to accidentally
dig into bedrock. This is not a hard rule, but around 90% of the surfaces need to have this thickness. The exception for this are (1xYx1) Chaos rooms, as they are too small otherwise, and may use 2 blocks thick surfaces.</li>
<li>POI chests and spawner: Every POI needs at least an amount of chests equal to its length, and 1 trial spawner.</li>
<li>When making a Chaos room, at least 1/3 of the doors must remain open. To close other doors, remove the jigsaw blocks. Do not
fill the doorway with bedrock, this will be generated automatically.</li>
<li>POIs should not have water on the edge of the structure, not even at the ground level layer. This is to prevent leakage when the floor the POI gets placed on is uneven.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spawning-template"><a class="header" href="#spawning-template">Spawning template</a></h3>
<p>On the build server, a template for every structure is provided, and placed in an appropriate location. To make locating this easy, Stable room templates are light gray, Unstable room templates
are pink, and Chaos room templates are red. If there are no empty templates for the structure you want to build, please contact a build coordinator.</p>
<p>In a singleplayer world, you can use the command <code>/spawnpiece wotr:templates/[structure]</code> to spawn in the template of the structure you want to build. Be careful, they might be bigger than expected, and there is no undo command.</p>
<h3 id="using-fixed-processor-blocks"><a class="header" href="#using-fixed-processor-blocks">Using fixed processor blocks</a></h3>
<p>There are fixed and custom processor blocks. Fixed processor blocks are always used for the same purpose, a wall processor block should always be used for walls.
Numbers 1-8 are fixed, see table below for their use. Use these when making builds, both rooms and POIs, so the processors can easily target them.
A theme will always make sure that those blocks will be turned into thematic blocks.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Color</th><th>ID</th><th>Name</th><th>Use</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Grey</td><td>1</td><td><code>processor_block_1</code></td><td>Walls</td></tr>
<tr><td>Orange</td><td>2</td><td><code>processor_block_2</code></td><td>Paths</td></tr>
<tr><td>Green</td><td>3</td><td><code>processor_block_3</code></td><td>Floors</td></tr>
<tr><td>Purple</td><td>4</td><td><code>processor_block_4</code></td><td>Alt Wall</td></tr>
<tr><td>Blue</td><td>5</td><td><code>processor_block_5</code></td><td>Dark Floor</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yellow</td><td>6</td><td><code>processor_block_6</code></td><td>Planks</td></tr>
<tr><td>Black</td><td>7</td><td><code>processor_block_7</code></td><td>Bricks</td></tr>
<tr><td>L_Blue</td><td>8</td><td><code>processor_block_8</code></td><td>Alt Path</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Where walls, paths and floors comprise the bulk of the room.</p>
<p>Alt wall can be used for etching, and indicators like cracks. Dark floor can be used in corners, further away from the path. Planks will (almost) always be planks, for things like bridges. Bricks can be used to indicate a more solid part.
The alt path can be used to surround the path, to make it blend in a bit more.
Water can be used as the themed liquid. If you want themed leaves, use 'processor_block_6_glass', which will often be turned into leaves. If you always want leaves, use a custom processor block family. Glass panes can also be turned into iron bars, because Mojang sees them as being similar.</p>
<p>The specific blocks have a suffix like: <code>processor_block_1_slab</code>.
Every family of processor blocks contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full block</li>
<li>Pillar</li>
<li>Slab</li>
<li>Stairs</li>
<li>Wall</li>
<li>Button</li>
<li>Pressure plate</li>
<li>Fence</li>
<li>Fence gate</li>
<li>Glass</li>
<li>Glass pane</li>
<li>Trapdoor</li>
</ul>
<img src="builds/processor_family.png" alt="processor_family" width="50%"/>
<h3 id="using-custom-processor-blocks"><a class="header" href="#using-custom-processor-blocks">Using custom processor blocks</a></h3>
<p>You can also use custom processor blocks, if you want a block that does not fit in any of the fixed categories, or if you want a block
to always be from the same set.
Examples are: glass or wood. A glass block does not belong to Wall or Floor, but having the color randomly be generated is nice, so you can use a custom processor block for this.
When you are creating a tree, you always want this to be made out of wood, regardless of theme, so use a custom processor block for this too.
The reason those are not fixed processor blocks, is that only a small amount of structures will use them, and now the processor block number can be used for other things, with other structures.</p>
<p>If you use custom processor blocks, you must provide the processor yourself. This will be explained in a later Chapter.<br />
The full set of processor blocks is shown below, where the first 8 are fixed families, and the last 7 are custom.</p>
<img src="builds/palette_full.png" alt="palette_full" width="50%"/>
<h3 id="lighting"><a class="header" href="#lighting">Lighting</a></h3>
<p>A low level nightvision is given to players when entering the rift, so adding light in rooms is not required. Natural lighting (torches, lanterns) may be added, as well as the creative lights (operator utilities tab), to highlight certain locations.</p>
<h3 id="pois-in-rooms"><a class="header" href="#pois-in-rooms">POIs in Rooms</a></h3>
<p>When building a room, you need to include POIs. This can be done by adding Jigsaw Blocks. A POI will be generated against the Jigsaw, so it must be placed a bit further. This means that for a free standing poi, the Jigsaw must be placed 2 blocks deep in the floor. The same applies to halfway POIs, but for those you must also have the small line on the Jigsaw block towards you, and away from the wall. It should also be placed against the wall. The ceiling Jigsaw must be placed 2 layers in the ceiling. For the in-wall Jigsaw, however, placement is different. Those must be placed against the wall, with the face towards the wall. This is because when it generates, it generates towards the wall, and thus be placed inside. A placement example is on the server, or can be loaded with <code>wotr:guides/jigsaw_placement</code>.<br />
<img src="builds/Jigsaw_example.png" alt="jigsaw_example" width="50%"/></p>
<p>Load <code>wotr:guides/jigsaw_palette</code> to get the correct settings for all Jigsaw blocks. You can control middle-click the one you want, and place it on the correct location. They are named, so they are distinguishable in your inventory. Keep in mind how far the POI you place will reach in every dimension, they will destroy blocks when necessary! In-wall POIs do carve deep, and free standing go up high.<br />
<img src="builds/jigsaw_palette.png" alt="jigsaw_palette" width="50%"/></p>
<h3 id="server-build-indicators"><a class="header" href="#server-build-indicators">Server Build Indicators</a></h3>
<p>On the server, wool blocks are used to indicate the status of your Room, and the sizes of the POIs. If you've installed the resource pack, they have replaced the wool textures. POI size indicators have a number on them. The status blocks indicate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red: Still building.</li>
<li>Yellow: Would like feedback for finishing touches.</li>
<li>Lime: Finished, ready for review.</li>
<li>Blue: Want help with placing POIs.</li>
<li>Cyan: The POIs are placed by builder.</li>
</ul>
<p>To set your structure as finished, you have to add the name on the Builders sheet. Only then it can be put in the mod.<br />
<img src="builds/status_blocks.png" alt="status_blocks" width="50%"/></p>
<h3 id="saving"><a class="header" href="#saving">Saving</a></h3>
<p>To save your created structure, locate the structure block for saving. For rooms, they are the inner structure block. For
POIs, they are the top structure block. Make sure you use the correct naming convention, as written in rules. To save, press the right "SAVE" button.<br />
<img src="builds/save_room.png" alt="save_room" width="50%"/><img src="builds/save_poi.png" alt="save_poi" width="50%"/></p>
<p>To allow the mod to use your structure, copy-paste the structure name into the Builders Sheet in the correct location (Room and POI
tabs). Ask in chat for a review.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4-making-processors"><a class="header" href="#chapter-4-making-processors">Chapter 4: Making processors</a></h2>
<p>To start with processor generation using excel sheets, download the following zip file:
<code>json_generator.zip</code> from <a href="builds/">here</a> <em>Link broken, WIP</em>.
It uses <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3</a>.
It is also useful to open Jade plugin setting in-game (num 0 by default), scroll down to the very bottom and enable both "Registry Name" and "Block States".
This makes you able to see the names of the blocks you want to use, and their properties.<br />
In the sheets, only the <strong>yellow</strong> cells should be filled in, but not all yellow cells need to be completed.</p>
<p>For most processors, a value called "step size" is used, which is like a weight for the given block, dictating how often it gets used. It is not equal to percentage,
as it scales exponentially down. A step size of 25 for block A and 75 for block B will give a 50/50 distribution when generated. The random noise used is simplex,
it will generate smooth, organic-looking patterns with continuous gradients, like layered spheres. A good way to grasp the step size values is to see it as an onion, with the first
input being the outer layer, and every following input being one layer towards the center. When peeling the onion, the outer layer will be bigger than the inner layer, even tho they are both 1 layer, and the same holds for
step size, even when given the same value. The sum of the steps need to equal 1, anything higher will not get
used, and lower means some of the processor blocks will not get transformed. The processor input <code>noise_scale_</code>, followed by <code>x, y, z</code>,
controls the size of the total onion, and its layers. Smaller values give larger onions.</p>
<h3 id="custom-processors"><a class="header" href="#custom-processors">Custom processors</a></h3>
<p>To create a custom processor for 1 processor block, use <code>processor_single_sheet.xlsx</code>. If you want to use a custom processor for multiple processor blocks, use
<code>processor_multiple_sheet.xlsx</code> instead. You only need to fill in the yellow cells of the blocks you've used, but make sure it is for the right number processor block.
State is the block the processor block turns into, for example <code>minecraft:stone</code>, and step size is as explained above.
Checksum will turn green if the total is 1, as indicator.</p>
<p>A processor will generate a number between 0 and 1, and will look what block it wants to replace.
Then, it will stack the steps from left to right, adding the numbers, and look for the block that belongs to this number.
Let's say it wants to replace <code>processor_block_10</code>, and generates number <code>0.7</code>. Now if, for example, in the spreadsheet you
have <code>minecraft:stone   0.6</code> and <code>minecraft:dirt   0.4</code>, it will replace <code>processor_block_10</code> into <code>minecraft_dirt</code>. If, instead,
the number generated was <code>0.3</code>, the block turns into <code>minecraft_stone</code>. So, every block is like another layer in an onion, with the step sizes
being the thickness of the layer, and the left-most step being the outer layer.</p>
<p>When you're done filling in the rows of the blocks you have used, save the sheet as:
<code>processor_single_sheet.csv</code> or <code>processor_multiple_sheet.csv</code>, respectively. Place this file in the same folder as the belonging python script
(<code>single_json_generator.py</code> or <code>multiple_json_generator.py</code>). Run this, and enter the type of structure you want this processor for, either Room or POI.
Do not change the output name, please.</p>
<p>The last thing to do, is filling in the name of your custom processor into the Builders sheet, and give the json file to a Build Coordinator.
When approved, they will put it into the mod, together with your structure.</p>
<h3 id="making-a-theme"><a class="header" href="#making-a-theme">Making a theme</a></h3>
<p>Before making a theme, please inform the Build Coordinator, to make sure it can get used and no double themes are made.</p>
<h4 id="excel-way"><a class="header" href="#excel-way">Excel way</a></h4>
<p>To start making a theme, use the <code>processor_theme_sheet.xlsx</code> sheet.
Theme making is similar to custom processor making, but require a state for every processor block. This is because builders can use every fixed processor block, with the knowledge it
will be processed when generated. The checksum column should be fully green.
Save this as <code>processor_theme_sheet.csv</code>, and run the python script. Enter Room or POI (often you want both, so run twice), and pick the custom choices in the popup. For POIs this is
only a chest for now, so press "OK", and you're done. For rooms, more options are available. At the top, there are a few toggle options, for if you want mushrooms or not,
for example. Below that, under the "Attachments" section, there are more customizable options. A list of example attachments is below in <a href="builds/tutorial.html#appendix-a">Appendix A</a>. This can
generate lanterns on the ceiling, rails on the floor, or bee nests on the walls, for example, but more are possible. "Name" is the name of the block you want to attach,
"Rarity" is how often it occurs (between 0 and 1), "Up" is if it requires to touch the ceiling, "Down" is for when it requires to touch a floor, "Sides" is for how many walls it has to
be up against, "Property" is a block property you can give it, and "Value" is the value of that property. Try different rarities and properties to find whatever suits your theme.
Using Jade in-game with the advanced settings enabled, you can find the properties in the box. It is currently not possible to adjust the "facing" property to the wall it touches, so
torches against the wall do not stick out of the wall, but are rotated.</p>
<h4 id="worldedit-way"><a class="header" href="#worldedit-way">WorldEdit way</a></h4>
<p>To get started with this, get yourself a theme template (Server: test zone, singleplayer: <code>/spawnpiece wotr:guides/theme_palette</code>).
Make sure that the full processor block is facing north (use F3), and your chosen blocks will be placed to the right of it, as in the first image below.
For every processor block type, place blocks next to it in which you want the processor block to be processed into, see second image below.
Do this for all 8 numbers of processor block families. When finished, for all processor block families, leftclick the main processor block in 1 corner with a wooden axe,
and rightclick bedrock in the opposing corner with the wooden axe, and type <code>/copy</code>. This should copy the entire section for 1 processor
block family. Then, type <code>/schem share</code>, and click the generated link. Download the file, and rename it to <code>processor#.schem</code>, but replace
the <code>#</code> with the number processor block you've copied. Repeat this for all families, you should have 8 <code>.schem</code> files.</p>
<img src="builds/builders_theme_north.png" alt="processor_north" width="50%"/>
<img src="builds/build_theme_worldedit_PBfill.png" alt="processor_theme" width="50%"/>
<p>Now, download <a href="https://github.com/Bullzey/schematic_to_json_wotr/blob/main/dist/theme_json_generator.zip">the theme json generator ZIP</a> (right side, little download icon), and extract anywhere. In the <code>theme_json_generator</code> folder (which should include an exe
file and some folders) create a new folder with name <code>theme_#</code>, replacing <code>#</code> with the name you want to give your theme,
and place the 8 <code>.schem</code> files inside this. The folder <code>theme_name</code> is an example, ignore the subfolders. Once finished,
run <code>theme_json_generator.exe</code>, and select your theme folder. Then, select either <code>POI</code> or <code>Room</code>, and press <code>OK</code> (often you want both, so run twice).
Both options should output a <code>.json</code> file.</p>
<h5 id="poi"><a class="header" href="#poi">POI</a></h5>
<p>The noise scale inputs are explained at the start of <a href="builds/tutorial.html#chapter-4-making-processors">chapter 4</a>, but can often be left as default.
The chest checkbox and rarity can also be unchanged, so just press <code>OK</code>.
<em>More options will come, WIP</em></p>
<h5 id="room"><a class="header" href="#room">Room</a></h5>
<p>The noise scale inputs are explained at the start of <a href="builds/tutorial.html#chapter-4-making-processors">chapter 4</a>, but can often be left as default.
The mushroom and vines checkboxes can be checked, when you want to include them into your theme. The rarity can be tweaked upon preference.
Below that, under the "Attachments" section, there are more customizable options. A list of example attachments is below in <a href="builds/tutorial.html#appendix-a">Appendix A</a>. This can
generate lanterns on the ceiling, rails on the floor, or bee nests on the walls, for example, but more are possible. "Name" is the name of the block you want to attach,
"Rarity" is how often it occurs (between 0 and 1), "Up" is if it requires to touch the ceiling, "Down" is for when it requires to touch a floor, "Sides" is for how many walls it has to

<li><strong>Feature</strong>: Something that is already decided or we have to do this either way. <em>Example: Rift Generation, Structure Generation, Modifier System (our better version of enchantments)</em></li>
<li><strong>Proof of Concept (PoC)</strong>: One of the suggestions given by people. By creating a PoC, we will be able to test it out. To be considered a PoC, the concept needs to be well defined already. If we have a PoC and people have clear issues with the gameplay it brings, we must shift to on another PoC. <em>Example: Gear Sockets, Skill Crystals, Cost of dying</em></li>
<li><strong>Spike</strong>: A spike is a concept that still requires discussion and investigation. Some preliminary work can be done, to see if the idea is feasible. A Spike can not be considered a PoC if aspects of it are still a Spike. Once a spike has been fleshed out enough on core concepts this should be converted to PoC as soon as possible to further expand and see how it tests <em>Example: Multiblock Altar, Wireframe Minimap, Abilities</em></li>
<li><strong>Datapack</strong>: A task to add a set of jsons as per <a href="code/datapack/datapack-formats.html">the datapack formats</a>. This task usually follows up on a relevant code ticket. This can be picked up by people with no skills in java.</li>

<li><strong>JigSaw</strong>: The technical vanilla minecraft system that is used to place a structure into the world.</li>
<li><strong>Processors</strong>: The technical vanilla minecraft system that allows a Structure Piece in a JigSaw to be modified and drastically change its looks.</li>
<li><strong>Structure Piece</strong>: A single piece of a JigSaw structure, in our case, one room.</li>
<li><strong>Gridsize (lenght)</strong>: The lenght of a single dimension of the smallest possible room. All other size rooms are multiplications of this (1x, 2x or 3x). The grid value we are working with is: 15.</li>
<li><strong>roomsize</strong>: The size of the rooms, often noted as XxYxZ, and mostly multiples of the gridsize is used, ie: 3x3x3. Note that the Y value denotes height.</li>
<li><strong>Standard room</strong>: Rooms made out of processor blocks, that after being processed, makes the rooms the game is played in. Standard come in varying room sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Processor blocks</strong>:	A few groups of blocks that the processor replaces with themed blocks. Those blocks are used in standard rooms, to be themed with a processor every time they are generated in game.</li>
<li><strong>Theme</strong>: A set of blocks linked to each used processor block, all with a weight (probability). The processor uses this to determine which block needs to be used to replace every processor block in the standard room.</li>
<li><strong>Point of Interest (PoI)</strong>:	A small structure that is generated inside the room, containing mob spawners and loot. They can be either: standing isolated on ground, partly inside the wall, in a corner, or hanging from the ceiling. All can have varying sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Doorway</strong>: A 3x5 hole in the wall, through which a player gets in or out of a room. They are on set locations, often (but not exlusively) 1 on each vertical face, so 4 per room. Rooms are generated from doorway to doorway, with a ring in between.</li>
<li><strong>Ring</strong>: A 3x5x1 ring of blocks, between 2 doorways. They are used to connect rooms, and to generate the next room.</li>
<li><strong>Stable room</strong>: A strictly 3x3x3 room, with a door in the middle of each verical face. All 4 doors are easely reachable from one another, without having to dig or travel large parts of the room. Stable rooms are the first rooms in the rift, and they are straightforward and coherent.</li>
<li><strong>Unstable room</strong>: A 3xYx3 room, with doors in the center only. The doors are not necessarily easily reachable, and a player might require to first travel to a corner, before having access to the door. Mostly used as a room between Stable and Chaos.</li>
<li><strong>Chaos room</strong>: All other rooms that are not Stable or Unstable. Doors are on set places, but not all door are open, and not every face has exactly 1 door. Those rooms are confusing and complex, and are placed on the outside of the rift.</li>

<h2 id="question-1"><a class="header" href="#question-1">Question</a></h2>
<p>Should we remove enchanting from the mod? It is by itself already a heated topic. WotRift will introduce a new modifier system that will make enchanting fairly obsolete.</p>

<p>The enchanting table will no longer work and no enchantments can be applied to items. Will affect all vanilla and modded items.</p>
<p>Modded enchants in the pack that are necessary for mod features to work will be reworked into the modifier system.</p>
<p><em>Design note</em>: Something like this would require an adequate replacement for improving gear. The current Gear Sockets and runegem <em>PoC</em>, applicable to vanilla items too, covers such a need. Other directions with modifiers would require to keep this poll result into account.</p>
<h3 id="yes-but-only-remove-for-wotrift-items-1"><a class="header" href="#yes-but-only-remove-for-wotrift-items-1">Yes, but only remove for WotRift items</a></h3>
<p>The enchanting table will not work for items from the WotRift mod. Vanilla items and items from other mods will still be enchantable, but their enchants will be disabled in the rifts.</p>
<p><em>Technical note</em>: Disabling enchants in the rift is a very complex endeavor and will require a lot of work. This option thus is considered the worst possible option by the dev team.</p>
<h3 id="no-enchanting-should-stay-but-disabled-in-rifts"><a class="header" href="#no-enchanting-should-stay-but-disabled-in-rifts">No, Enchanting should stay, but disabled in rifts</a></h3>
<p>Enchanting will remain in the mod. Items can still be enchanted as normal. But most or all of the enchants will be disabled in rifts to prevent balancing issues.</p>
<p><em>Technical note</em>: See previous point.</p>
<h3 id="no-enchanting-should-stay-and-be-usable-in-rifts"><a class="header" href="#no-enchanting-should-stay-and-be-usable-in-rifts">No, Enchanting should stay and be usable in rifts</a></h3>
<p>Enchanting will remain in the mod. Items can still be enchanted as normal. Rifts will be balanced around this, this will make the modifier system less useful and less impactful, especially when overpowered modded enchants are added. Consideration need to be made to make enchanting the main modifier system.</p>

<p>This poll is currently running in discord until saturday the 22th of March</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p><strong>Wall POI Depth Poll</strong>
When placing POIs against walls, we require a predefined depth -- a standard for how much they will "sink into" the wall. This is for the MVP so far, <strong>more options can be picked/added later</strong>, when we have made a solid amount and want more variation. As always, we'll determine this through a poll. Here are the options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On the wall</strong> -- POI is attached to the wall, sinking just 1 block in to match the surroundings.</li>
<li><strong>In the wall</strong> -- POI is fully embedded into the wall, creating a cave.</li>
<li><strong>Halfway</strong> -- POI is partially inside the wall, other half sticking out.</li>
</ul>
<p>See provided images for an overview, and examples for each. Note that this poll is NOT about the appearance of the POIs, ONLY about how deep we want them to be. They also have different sizes. There is also an example on the Build Server, have a look there to see the differences for yourself.</p>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to all options:
<strong>On the wall</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pro: No thick walls required. Very visible from distance.</li>
<li>Con: Somewhat similar to free-standing POIs. Takes up more floor space.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the wall</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pro: Saves floor space. Very distinct from other POI types.</li>
<li>Con: Thick walls required, as POI depth must be fully covered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Halfway</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pro: Distinct from other POIs. Versatile: can accommodate both On-wall POIs that don't demand full surface area, and In-wall POIs that are shallow. Less demanding on room building</li>
<li>Con: Not a champion in either: can't have deep caves or POIs sticking out far</li>
</ul>
<p>Thick walls and open floor areas limit building flexibility, hence are a real downside.</p>
<p>There is an option to pick multiple depths, however keep in mind that this essentially means <strong>splitting</strong> the available POI pool, requiring double the designs to be created.
We can always <strong>add <strong>more depth levels pools</strong> later on</strong>, if we are loaded with POIs. At this moment, we have far from enough for current pools, so adding more options hinders a lot.</p>

<h2 id="which-mods-should-we-add-to-increase-themes"><a class="header" href="#which-mods-should-we-add-to-increase-themes">Which mods should we add to increase themes?</a></h2>
<p>To make beautiful themes, we need some more blocks than vanilla offers. First of all, those mods need to be not ARR (licensed). This is so that when the mod gets discontinued, we can take the code and continue it ourselves, making it future proof and not a liability. There is a forum post that contains a list of mods, which has been distilled to no-ARR and 1.21.4.
All mods will NOT affect gameplay/worldgen. The first 6 by default, the last by changing config (which will be done).</p>
<p>The downside, however, to adding mods is that when it gets discontinued, we have to update them, or our mod breaks too.
This does bring extra work to Devs (or whoever takes responsibility). For some mods this will not be much work, as they only add blocks, but for others it might be. More and complex additions means more work.
Due to the licencing, we can scrape the textures for them and add to our own mod. Most mods do have a reputation of supporting new versions.</p>
<p>The mods are listed below, with summaries of what they add. Textures are things like a creeper face on a block, shapes are things like stairs or slabs, and decorations are things like lanterns.</p>
<p>They are sorted from simple to complex mods.</p>
<h2 id="mods-to-consider"><a class="header" href="#mods-to-consider">Mods to Consider</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chisel reborn</strong>: Adds textures to blocks (full blocks only)</li>
<li><strong>Block variants</strong>: Adds shapes to existing blocks</li>
<li><strong>Stoneworks</strong>: Adds textures and shapes</li>
<li><strong>Dusty Decorations</strong>: Adds decorations. Only interaction: climbable rope</li>
<li><strong>Glassentials</strong>: Adds glass (trap)doors, has redstone/light blocks, ethereal blocks</li>
<li><strong>Oh The Biomes We've Gone</strong>: Adds textures, shapes, colours. Adds flowers, saplings, food. Adds mobs. Adds decoration. Adds recoloured crafting table, boat, button etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="procon"><a class="header" href="#procon">Pro/Con</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Pro: More blocks to build with, so we can make more interesting themes and are not limited by vanilla. It also adds decorative blocks.</li>
<li>Con: We need to update those mods when they get discontinued (although, same needs to happen if we create a blocks-mod ourselves, but now for more). It will also make the minimum required pack a bit larger.</li>

<li>Cjzech - there is <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1377663029595869254/1385358144279937084">a writeup you can read about here</a>. The slide is just saying we can always go and redefine later if needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MattDoesEverything - With the tie regarding essence discussion, what are our next steps for Essence, as it seems to be our base foundation?
<ul>
<li>Cjzech - need to go back and figure out what would work best for the pack. Will work with those who made the essence system suggestions to see if we can rework/re-summarize ideas. See if we can work with Divides by Zero to work out what else is needed with crafting essences/making bigger and stronger essences to better define it for everyone else.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Danymaddox
<ul>
<li>Barry Allen - we don’t have a protocol, but could maybe create it. Ask the build navigators</li>
<li>Wout - best way would be to work with a build navigator so they can add it to the build server. Use your name on the spreadsheet so if there are any questions or feedback you can relay it to them for changes. See Builders Sheets (third bullet point) and other helpful information like build server modpack and build tutorial here: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1382748526915747870">build-start-here</a></li>

<li>And welcome to everyone we missed due to the big influx!!!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are we making?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wanderers of the Rift (WotR) is a new Minecraft modpack in the aRPG-pack genre. This is a community driven and developed project likely to end up in 1.22 Neoforge Minecraft</li>
<li>Inspired by modern day aRPG endgame mechanics
<ul>
<li>Path of Exile 1/2</li>
<li>Last Epoch</li>
<li>Diablo</li>
<li>Minecraft Dungeons</li>
<li>… (not an exhaustive list)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To get a good feel of the vibe WotR wants to create, check out PoE end game, and MC Dungeons</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is a modern aRPG</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time combat</li>
<li>Strong looting and itemization</li>
<li>Character Progression</li>
<li>Isometric/Top Down
<ul>
<li>not sure if we want</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Endgame Loop
<ul>
<li>Tiered Dungeons/Maps</li>
<li>Extended Variety</li>
<li>Bosses</li>
<li>Targeted Farming</li>
<li>Seasonal Content</li>
<li>Roguelite Elements
<ul>
<li>Not making a roguelike/roguelite, just borrowing some elements</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get inspired by the previously mentioned modern aRPGs!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Participation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Active participation checked every 2-3 weeks</li>
<li>Counts for ALL roles
<ul>
<li>Navigators and Project Leaders will be actively replaced</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Roles removed, no member will be kicked from the Discord</li>
<li>Reapplication is easy, same as the current process (<a href="https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1377644503900487792">open a ticket here</a>)</li>
<li>Breaks are possible (and encouraged!)
<ul>
<li>Reach out to project manager or coordinator to let them know of an impending break</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>See Rules and Values for details</li>
<li>Main thing is keeping people engaged and keep moving the project forward, while keeping an accurate counts of people in each team</li>
<li>It’s a long process (two months overall) to reach the role removal stage, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1377643150826278973/1384912554639364110">see outline here</a>
<ul>
<li>Reiterating people will not be kicked, just need to go through onboarding ticketing process to get team roles again</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Release Updates 0.1.4</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Things work again!</li>
<li>More theme variety
<ul>
<li>Mesa</li>
<li>Bees</li>
<li>Desert</li>
<li>Swamp</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NoGrav Blocks
<ul>
<li>Sand, gravel, concrete powder that do not fall</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rifts work again…
<ul>
<li>(Noted as a good thing)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>RiftFaster, maybe?!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Development Approach</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Generic Code
<ul>
<li>Easy Shifts Later - code is flexible</li>
<li>Development and Lore (and Game Design) parallel</li>
<li>Can save time with this approach</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Framework Mod
<ul>
<li>Others could use things we create for their own mods/modpacks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maximum Datapackable
<ul>
<li>Make it so others can make changes without altering the mod itself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>High Configurability
<ul>
<li>Voting (in Discord) is often for defaults</li>
<li>Code will support more</li>
<li>Allows new ideas to be implemented that may be different from the default settings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Low performance impacts
<ul>
<li>Rift generation was reworked to make everything as low impact as possible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accessibility
<ul>
<li>Always considered</li>
<li>See settings already implemented, like arachnophobia, and others on the accessibility menu we plan to add in the future</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nothing is sacred, anything can change
<ul>

<h3 id="-summary-and-decisions-"><a class="header" href="#-summary-and-decisions-">== Summary and decisions ==</a></h3>
<p>Release 0.1.1 is out and 0.1.2 coming soon</p>
<p>Updates to balancing
New runegems added, new command for reporting bugs “/wotr reportBug”
Nether theme added by Jyu, Noir theme added by Wout and Grimm
Monster runegem geodes added</p>
<h3 id="-testing-"><a class="header" href="#-testing-">== Testing ==</a></h3>
<p>Very positive feedback so far, please give more feedback.
Feedback threads exist for the big topics
Brainstorms added for future ideas threads</p>
<p>New thread for community servers added in community section, can post servers you have available with notes about what they are.</p>
<p>Note this current release hasn't been tested in multiplayer at all so make use of bug reports for anything which goes wrong.</p>
<h3 id="-brainstorming-updates-"><a class="header" href="#-brainstorming-updates-">== Brainstorming Updates ==</a></h3>
<p>Chainminer brainstorm paused pending clarity on how chests are broken.</p>
<p>Lore:
Planning on getting some polls out today about story ideas, greebls, etc.
There are currently roughly 9 story ideas to work through and centralize</p>
<p>Focuses for the next week are: Factions and Guilds, Discovering lore, Quest Lore, and Essence force.
Try to keep to story and not gameplay mechanics since gameplay mechanics are limiting where story is more free.</p>
<h3 id="-demos-"><a class="header" href="#-demos-">== Demos ==</a></h3>
<p>Riftfaster added for MUCH faster rift generation.</p>
<p>Rune anvil, needs runegems to work with. Runegem geodes can be raw or framed and come from any chest in rift, Framed are found more commonly in higher tier rifts. Right click to open geode and it will give you a Runegem (tags show where it is socketable). Not all runegems are applicable to all slots, for example jump height is only on legs and boots. The runegems have more variety in modifiers in framed versions.</p>
<p>Gear has implicits example: iron helmet gives attack damage. When applying runegems in rune anvil shapes will need to match what is rolled on gear, left side will show current version of the item, and right will show updated version after runegems are applied.</p>
<p>Monster runegem geodes have unique shape currently this may change later.</p>
<p>Rune gems can be overwritten to “reroll” the modifier which is applied.</p>

<p>Release 0.1.0 today!!!
Including:
Basic rifting with some form of scaling (we will need to balance this still but something exists)
2 Themes currently, more coming soonTM
Build team killed it and repetition of rooms/pois is reduced a lot but will go down even more as more themes are added.
Basic objectives currently we only have kill mobs.
Rift Key generation using essences
Sockets and runegems are available on vanilla gear
Vanilla gear supports implicit modifiers
3 Abilities in game currently: Fireball, Dash, Heal
Loot is in game</p>
<p>There will be files released for Curseforge/Modrinth.</p>
<p>Considerations:
No balance testing done yet, minimal bug testing done, focus on functionality, no riftmapper (Yet), GeckoLib required, Low performance during rift gen currently.</p>
<h3 id="-testing--1"><a class="header" href="#-testing--1">== Testing ==</a></h3>
<p>Areas to focus on while testing:
Is it fun?
What is missing?
Are there bugs?</p>
<p>GitHub Bug Logging - this is the place to log bugs/feedback</p>
<p>Testing team (coming maybe in future)</p>
<h3 id="-build-updates-"><a class="header" href="#-build-updates-">== Build Updates ==</a></h3>
<p>Lots of rooms added
Review can be done in review channel under the build category</p>
<h3 id="-art-updates-"><a class="header" href="#-art-updates-">== Art Updates ==</a></h3>
<p>Art waiting for lore to get built to move forward.
Art guidelines will be built from that, and then actual art will come from those guidelines.</p>
<p>Current things to do: Update current assets! Make things for the main theme/branding.</p>
<p>Some general guidelines are added but are still being updated.</p>
<h3 id="-brainstorming-updates--1"><a class="header" href="#-brainstorming-updates--1">== Brainstorming Updates ==</a></h3>
<p>Brainstormings will be focused on things that are currently in MVP, things that are needed.</p>
<p>Lore brainstorms we want to focus on (anyone can add here):
Story ideas - goal to have something by next week
Greebls
Factions/Guilds</p>

<p>Tiebreaker poll for name - Wanderers of the Rift won! We will start using the new name.</p>
<p>New channel called community polls - used for polls to community, 1st poll is durability poll to decide if we are keeping durability.</p>
<p>Enchanting - do we want Vanilla like enchanting in the game and to what extent. Check out discussion in the forums. Probably going to have poll on enchanting poll next week.</p>
<h2 id="-mvp-updates--6"><a class="header" href="#-mvp-updates--6">== MVP Updates ==</a></h2>
<p>We really need rooms! We only have two rooms and one POI.</p>
<p>Builds are really important so we can have interesting rifts. We are wanting to aim for even more than VH.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to throw something down even if you don't consider yourself good at building.</p>
<p>Decision Process - Discussion in voice or chat -&gt; Idea polishing in Forums -&gt; Polling for options (more than 2) -&gt; Guidelines / Results published on mdBook once decision is taken -&gt; Changes/Actions timelines depending on decisions.</p>
<p>Also reference guide in mdBook:  https://dimension-delvers.github.io/dimension-delvers-docs/polls/polls.html</p>
<p>We wont have a playtesting team, everyone is the playtesting team</p>
<h2 id="-deemos--1"><a class="header" href="#-deemos--1">== Deemos ==</a></h2>
<p>Skill gem demo from Divides By Zero - Different gems would be upgradable with different number/tier of options. Skill trees are randomly generated per gem, so two base gems are not necessarily going to end up being the same.</p>
<p>Ability demo from Patrigan created by RobotMonkey - ability that summons skeletons and then they explode and die when they hit the ground. Cooldown indicator top left. Summoning of skeletons is completely configured using datapacks. We have alot of flexibility and depth that can be done using the current system.  Ball Ball ability which has bouncy balls. Think of making abilities that work well together.</p>

<p>Discussion on our values and what sets us apart. (see slide)</p>
<p>Big shoutout to Wh4l3 for the work they have done this past week.</p>
<p>Tie breaker poll for name decision ⁠Wold's Vaults⁠Name ideas - List</p>
<h2 id="-mvp-updates--7"><a class="header" href="#-mvp-updates--7">== MVP Updates ==</a></h2>
<p>Key forge demo - rift key forge shown with different materials and different rift tiers being able to be created from more “expensive” materials. Materials used determine the theme of the rift. New portal texture and it is very cool.</p>
<p>Rift update - Portal room has 4 entrances/exits, performance side needs some work, rift level determines rift size, level 20 rift is bigger than the biggest vaults in VH, hallways are being removed.</p>
<p>Ditto Blocks - Added blocks that can copy the texture of other blocks, which allows us to give blocks different properties. One that was showcased was “Spring Blocks” which would have a trampoline like effect for the player. There is slight differentiation so you can tell the difference, they can be traps or be mined and used as a tool. “Trap Blocks” were also shown which disappear after a short time to drop the player below. There are also variations specifically to trigger on mob vs player.</p>
<p>Build server - needs more rooms and more POI’s please fill out form in build section for room ideas, feedback on rooms, take note of the structures and the processor blocks that have code currently, if you need a special one make note of it and preferably also code it. There is a room section and a POI section, we need more thoughts/examples for both.</p>

<h2 id="-summary-and-decisions--9"><a class="header" href="#-summary-and-decisions--9">== Summary and decisions ==</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A LOT of movements towards MVP in Rune Anvil/Socket, Rift Generation, Modifier System, Inventory Snapshots, Accessibility Configs, Builder Glasses, Rift Entry Portal, 3Dd Rift Mapper, First Chest Variant, Dev Tools.</li>
<li>Devs please delete branches that have been merged in.</li>
<li>Rift mapper is running and will be 3d because rift will have height as well.</li>
<li>Durability is removed from everything because durability is lame.</li>
<li>Accessibility setting added for different things that can be adjusted.</li>
<li>Rift entrance visual has been created.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-game-design-"><a class="header" href="#-game-design-">== Game Design ==</a></h2>
<p>Rifts:
Rift key - determining what this is/ how the player will create is really important for making progress in MVP
Rift entrance, themes, tiered rift levels, spawners, RiftMapper are also things to discuss.</p>
<p>Progression:
Skill trees - do we want or no? How do we wanna do them? What is a skill tree?
Gear Progression - How do we progress gear? Just modifiers or add more?
Gear base - how to make weapon/armor more unique?
Skill Mechanic - What type of skills will we have
Build-A-Spell - How do we want to do spells and have them easily expandable.
Abilities -
Endgame - what do we want to do for endgame? What should the player be working for? Please go discuss.</p>
<p>Other:
Durability - Gone
Unique Biomes - should this be in Overworld? What rift related things do we want to have in overworld?
Damage Types - how would we want to implement this? What type of damage types would we want?
Eras of Progression - Barry Summary: 5 eras, Era of Exploration keeps it pretty basic and goal is to introduce the player to the core mechanics of the modpack that are different from vanilla minecraft, Era of Expansion we start to add onto the core concepts bringing in some of the more complex aspects such as potentially modifying rifts/gear, skills open up alot more etc., Era of Stabilization/Experimentation Player has a decent grasp on what the pack adds and maybe has a build/playstyle they are actively working towards, or are experimenting with alot of playstyles and builds, Era of Perfection all tools are available to the player, probably the most grindy era focus is on perfecting the build and entering endgame content, Era of Conclusion the player is fully into the endgame and maybe big final boss fight, not all players necessarily make it here and thats ok.

<li>We were all aching to really get into it, Apologies for those unable to join.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</strong> is top priority. Developer was suggested to lead. @Xverion are you for leading an MVP discussion?
<ul>
<li>Determines what we will make first in order to have a playable mod</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Project Moderators</strong> will take the role of organizing and managing the chaos at least until the initial chaos gets under control. @iwolfking mentioned: @Xverion @DElyMyth @Harley and themself.
<ul>
<li>In uncontrolled discussions, they can break the discussion with a decision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Topic Moderators</strong> was suggested to take lead on various topics after an MVP is determined (or even before).
<ul>
<li>We summarized a lot of info, too much for 1 person</li>
<li>Will only moderate, has no decision power</li>
<li>Expert on the topic, knows all the pros and cons for each suggestion</li>
<li>Leads a meeting to flesh out before making decision</li>
<li>Topics include, but are not limited to: VaultGen, Gear Crafting, Lore, Multiplayer, Mods...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Name decision</strong> necessary, until then Vaults / crystals</li>
<li>Crystal charging requires an alternative than just flat items</li>
<li><strong>Research and mods</strong>
<ul>
<li>Everything available is overwhelming</li>
<li>Research blocks wanted items from being unnecessarily gatekept, like storage</li>
<li>Questbook as an alternative to research?</li>
<li>VH Coop Research needs tuning</li>
<li>No research but vaults/vault level open new mods (Req)</li>
<li>Restrict crafting, but not usage to make MP research useful (wolf)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>More loot sources needed</strong>
<ul>
<li>Chest tiers (jar =&gt; vessel =&gt; Chest)</li>
<li>Remove chest affinities, or reduce to one singular stat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Andy would like to do proper User story mapping, I support the idea :p</li>
<li><strong>Big Gear discussion</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enchantments. (using it fully / allowing it, but separate vault system / blocking it) Some want to stay closer to Minecraft on this, enchants also allow mopre mod compat. But harder to balance for enchants.</li>
<li>For sure, remove the enchantment glint</li>
<li>Several good (and bad :p) crafting suggestions</li>
<li>Remove durability? (iwolfking supports, Zing has concerns on replacing gear)</li>
<li>Zing suggests some approaches to replace vanilla enchants that seem mandatory (unbreaking efficiency)</li>
<li>do no limit enchants that can be put on gear, but deactivate enchants in vaults (technically more difficult)</li>
<li>Really need to start work on this topic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Endgame</strong> is very important and should be considered for MVP
<ul>
<li>Repeatable and enjoyable</li>
<li>Variety (more objectives and more unique objectives)</li>
<li>Should not just be about getting more and more overpowered gear</li>
<li>Just an End Boss speed fight is not fun</li>
<li>Bosses should have variety</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vaults leaking into Vanilla</strong>
<ul>
<li>Improved beginner experience</li>
<li>Find level 0 gear in overworld chests</li>
<li>Level skips / content skips for experienced players</li>
<li>Trial vaults as tutorial vaults</li>
<li>Raw vaults could spawn in overworld</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SkyBlock</strong> delving should be treated as equal!!!
<ul>
<li>Some do not like to travel 5k blocks</li>
<li>teleportation system suggested for the travel issue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Multi block</strong> altar / structures
<ul>
<li>Some persons were vocal about not liking multiblocks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>FTBQuests</strong> to replace the VH Quest book?
<ul>
<li>Why reinvent the wheel</li>
<li>Concerns about quality</li>
<li>Patrigan suggests the pages can look VERY unique with unique art and complex rules.</li>
<li>General Consensus seems to be VH quest book is not really great</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Create</strong> is not on 1.21
<ul>
<li>A lot of people really want create</li>
<li>Hopefully create will be there by the time MVP is done</li>
<li>Create's Ponder system would be good for newbies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lore</strong>
<ul>
<li>Should lore be vanilla MC adjacent (involving illagers or endermen)?</li>
<li>Or should we make it really unique, but risk not fitting with vanilla?</li>
<li>original VH God lore is lame and not really present.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>project Order should be
<ul>
<li>Codewise MVP =&gt; Lore and theme =&gt; proper art and expanding systems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>MC Dungeons</strong> can be a good example for a lot of stuff
<ul>
<li>Patrigan mentions having worked on Dungeons Suite mods, can probably convince them for models and resources</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transmogs</strong>
<ul>
<li>Name under discussion for also being in Vaults. Considered too standard to change.</li>
<li>Launching with MC Dungeons armors gives great variety already</li>
<li>ZXMBIE showcase a cool armor model already (see art-chat)</li>
<li>Get armors from mods in the pack as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some discussion on VH IP and stealing
<ul>
<li>General consensus: It is impossible to actually steal something by accident (even for Xverion if he copies code from head)</li>
<li>Malicious intent from our side is not ok and will not be tolerated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Wiki</strong> as main source for documentation
<ul>

<p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1386024438151249971">Ability Creation Guild</a>
Do we want a Poll on if the ability creation guild is about making abilities, improving them or both? Is this One guild, One with subgroups, multiple guilds? Yes</p>
<p>Guild factions within guilds, like food guild, with pie and strudel factions within food guild. Strudel big single buff and pies people pies are better, they give 2 buffs at 50%.</p>
<p>Note on accessibility – guild icons and quick notes on guilds are wanted<br />
before flowery/long text (in guild?). Map as well for any sort of hub world implemented</p>
<p>Reseller guild, buys things for 30% under cost<br />
selling to right guild 25% under cost (selling armor to an armorer guild)<br />
Selling under cost 50% to wrong guild</p>
<p>Discussion on what guilds are/ what they cover is 100% wanted. <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1387825112509710607">Guild Pitch Requirements</a></p>
<p>Lots of talk about guilds, mostly we don't know. Need more info.<br />
What guilds would be interesting.</p>
<p>Vote on hub world wanted.</p>
<p>Guilds at spawn for 1.02 guild update? Where should they exist at this stage?</p>
<p>Different species in hub and for players (species benefits/traits a player can choose from)? Start discussion?</p>
<p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1386378785770700860">Shrines</a></p>
<p>Changing shines name to Anomaly's<br />
if there are different yet unnamed types.</p>
<p>Lore that was agreed in chat and needs to be looked at and OKed by others<br />
- there is energy released when closing the anomaly's</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>this energy cause the effect then closed<br />
- when closing items / mobs can fall out of the hole if the size is right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk about using fabric terms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>anomalies are another reality trying to form a gateway to your reality by stitching itself to yours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to close the anomaly you have to cut the threads holding them together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In closing the anomaly (cutting the threads) the treads – effects, the thread turns to dust and covers the player, the threads unravel into a miss and dissipate into the room (rift/room effects?), the threads are sucked back into the anomaly knocking out an item (don't know if the last effect was in the meeting or an after note?)</p>
<p>Anomalies lore talked about but needs more discussion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anomalies need to be shut on both sides?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anomalies are made from unfinished rifts?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The team revisited ability guilds, aiming to rework past ideas with updated direction.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not class-based</strong>: Guilds should craft, enhance, or modify abilities. Not unlock them.</li>
<li><strong>Thematic Separation</strong>: Splitting ability by concepts, feel, or archetype.</li>
<li><strong>Guild consolidation</strong>: Barry suggested a unified guild model with sub-factions (merchant district style).</li>
<li><strong>Past proposals</strong>: Warren will compile old guild ideas for potential repurposing.</li>

<p>What a Hub World should be? Structurally, narratively, and technically. Strong creative interest, but ongoing questions around implementation and scalability.</p>
<h3 id="purpose"><a class="header" href="#purpose">Purpose</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Give guilds a shared anchor space that evolves over time.</li>
<li>Provide a canvas for storytelling, atmosphere, and game logic outside overworld constraints.</li>
<li>Enable multiplayer engagement, server events, and dynamic content delivery.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="progression"><a class="header" href="#progression">Progression</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>City starts small or “dead” and grows with reputation gain or key choices.</li>
<li>Barriers (walls, locked doors, invisible gates) gate progress.</li>
<li>Layered realities: multiple “versions” of the same hub depending on player progress.</li>
<li>Player choice (e.g., which guild to unlock).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multiplayer"><a class="header" href="#multiplayer">Multiplayer</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Player/team instance vs. shared server
<ul>
<li>Instanced: more personal, but hits performance and community</li>
<li>Shared: better for events, but progression disparity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reputation gating w/ barriers might help</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>There’s a strong push to build a tutorial experience that sets tone, teaches core systems, and integrates smoothly into broader gameplay without hand-holding or overwhelming players.</p>
<h3 id="starting-options"><a class="header" href="#starting-options">Starting Options</a></h3>
<p>Various proposals on where players begin:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a rift, immediately immersed in gameplay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Overworld, then triggered into a rift (e.g., after chopping a tree).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a Hub World, introduced to rift mechanics through a guided quest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concerns raised that forcing players into a rift early might feel abrupt or “jarring.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A compass to locate rifts or an early Greeble encounter could offer a softer on-ramp.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>Inspired by Skyrim’s Hadvar/Ralof opening, the Greeble could act as a quirky but functional guide.</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrates rune gem bartering (eats a gem and gives new gem).</li>
<li>Walks player through the first rift loop: enter &gt; loot POIs &gt; exit.</li>
<li>Introduces danger subtly (“something watching”).</li>
<li>May initiate a combat encounter where the player has to rescue the Greeble.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="key-tutorial-elements"><a class="header" href="#key-tutorial-elements">Key Tutorial Elements</a></h2>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Teach through action, not exposition. Avoid overly scripted or hand-holdy content.</li>
<li>Encourage exploration and self-directed learning by not locking players in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greeble eats a gem → bartering intro.</li>
<li>Player explores POIs → looting.</li>
<li>Greeble gets in trouble → combat.</li>

<p><em>Essence system expansion, Greeble tutorial guild, Fabric guild plans, Hub world discussion</em><br />
<em>Rune gems, progression, personality design, and voting notes</em></p>

<blockquote>
<h2 id="essence-system"><a class="header" href="#essence-system"><a href="lore/meetings/">Essence System</a></a></h2>
</blockquote>
<p>Essence is the base layer of magic and reality—think "magical atoms."</p>
<ul>
<li>Originally planned for magic only, it’s now being used for items, abilities, rune gems, and more.</li>
<li>Comparisons made to Avatar, Doodle God, Element Classic, and Black Clover.</li>
<li>Essence can be extracted from blocks / items from rifts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="essence-chart-breakdown"><a class="header" href="#essence-chart-breakdown">Essence Chart Breakdown</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Void is the origin of all essences.</li>
<li><strong>Main ring</strong>: light, fire, chaos, air, darkness, earth, order, and water.</li>
<li><strong>Outer ring (still in flux)</strong>: life, nether, plant, space, power, animal, end, death, crystal, metal, time.</li>
<li>Essences combine to create new ones (e.g., fire + earth = lava).</li>
<li>Basic essences = “threads”, combinations = “yarns” (fabric theme).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="integrations"><a class="header" href="#integrations">Integrations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Empty rune gems can be infused with essence.</li>
<li>Potential synergy bonuses if players build around a few essences.</li>
<li>Examples include a "lava Claymore" for crossover between tech and magic.</li>
<li>Essences may be physical items—e.g., turning an iron sword into a fire blade.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<h2 id="greebles--tutorial-role"><a class="header" href="#greebles--tutorial-role"><a href="lore/meetings/">Greebles &amp; Tutorial Role</a></a></h2>
</blockquote>
<p>Greebles are echo creatures made from leftover Rift essence—tiny critters that mimic what’s passed through.</p>
<ul>
<li>Act as the in-game tutorial introducing rune gems and rift mechanics.</li>
<li>Players first meet a Greeble struggling to open a geode.</li>
<li>After helping, it eats a gem and spits out a rune gem.</li>
<li>Quests revolve around feeding geodes to Greebles and unlocking guild abilities.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<h2 id="greeble-guild-design"><a class="header" href="#greeble-guild-design"><a href="lore/meetings/">Greeble Guild Design</a></a></h2>
</blockquote>
<p>The Greeble Guild is a starter/tutorial guild centered on rune gems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aesthetic leaning toward crystal caves or mineral buildup.</li>
<li>Greebles are gaseous beings inside shells; may build homes resembling their shells.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="progression-suggestions"><a class="header" href="#progression-suggestions">Progression Suggestions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Feed smaller Greebles for random gems.</li>
<li>Feed larger Greebles to rank up.</li>
<li>Greebles grow smarter and hungrier the more rune gems they eat.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<h2 id="greeble-identity--personality"><a class="header" href="#greeble-identity--personality"><a href="lore/meetings/">Greeble Identity &amp; Personality</a></a></h2>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mimic other guilds, often badly—this attracts wanderers to exploit them.</li>
<li>Described as goofy, gang-like, possibly pretending to be dumb (but maybe not).</li>
<li>Guild leader might be called "Big Boss" or "Big Brother."</li>
<li>Names like “Greebles” could be accidental, mispronounced, or just colloquial.</li>
<li>Guild name still TBD — ideas include “Gem Garners” and “The Great Hunger.”</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<h2 id="greeble-quests--progression"><a class="header" href="#greeble-quests--progression"><a href="lore/meetings/">Greeble Quests &amp; Progression</a></a></h2>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Quests focused on geode collection and gem transformation.</li>
<li>Rank progression tied to feeding rune gems to Greebles.</li>
<li>Quests should align with guild themes.</li>
<li>Repeatable quests and minimal complexity preferred for 0.2.0.</li>
<li>Possibility of Greeble rescue quests/objectives inside Rifts (e.g., defend, escort, rescue).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<h2 id="hub-world-ideas"><a class="header" href="#hub-world-ideas"><a href="lore/meetings/">Hub World Ideas</a></a></h2>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If chosen, each guild could get its own island.</li>
<li>Improves performance and centralizes interactions.</li>
<li>Hub world vote might determine focus for 0.3.0.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<h2 id="guild-system-expansion"><a class="header" href="#guild-system-expansion"><a href="lore/meetings/">Guild System Expansion</a></a></h2>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Two more guilds to be developed next.</li>
<li>Both should be fabric-themed.</li>
<li>Both focused on unlocking player abilities.</li>
<li>Ideas include “The Interwoven” and “The Tangled.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="concerns-raised"><a class="header" href="#concerns-raised">Concerns Raised</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Too many sources of abilities (not just guilds).</li>
<li>Compliance with fabric theme.</li>
<li>Overlap or competition among guilds.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<h2 id="next-session--voting"><a class="header" href="#next-session--voting"><a href="lore/meetings/">Next Session &amp; Voting</a></a></h2>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Develop the next two guilds: names, theme, quest style, abilities, etc.</li>
<li>Minecraft integration options will be voted on (from no vanilla to full integration).</li>
<li>Hub world vote will affect multiple systems.</li>
<li>Suggestion for ranked-choice voting to reflect nuanced preferences.</li>
<li>A new thread will be posted to gather ideas for the next meeting.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pitch-to-feature-process-rework"><a class="header" href="#pitch-to-feature-process-rework"><strong>Pitch to Feature Process Rework</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The current “Pitch to Feature” process is not working as intended.</p>
<ul>
<li>Was meant to open after MVP release but is sitting in limbo</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're exploring the creation of a new discord layout to support the intended flow of the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any revisions will be shared for community input and approval before implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation of example flow to show how process is intended to work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="poll-strategy-improvements"><a class="header" href="#poll-strategy-improvements"><strong>Poll Strategy Improvements</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All future feature polls will include a Docs Team summary to provide context and clarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poll durations will be tailored to topic complexity (quick turnaround feedback vs. long term strategic decisions).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="future-roadmapping--prioritization"><a class="header" href="#future-roadmapping--prioritization"><strong>Future Roadmapping &amp; Prioritization</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Considering a priority system to help the community signal which ideas should be worked on next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A rotating idea thread may be introduced to highlight actively discussed concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A high-level public roadmap to increase transparency into what’s coming next.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roadmap informed by priority system above</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="contributor-participation"><a class="header" href="#contributor-participation"><strong>Contributor Participation</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Contributor Ideas forum was moved to improve project organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although it is contributor visible only, the project has minimal entry barriers, so we continue to value broad community participation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="urgency--lore-alignment"><a class="header" href="#urgency--lore-alignment"><strong>Urgency &amp; Lore Alignment</strong></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Development began with high energy, and lore emphasis came slightly later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The team is aligned on the importance of building a foundational lore structure to keep pace with ongoing development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many contributors come from projects with little to no lore, so there is genuine excitement to create something rich and intentional.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lore-team-direction"><a class="header" href="#lore-team-direction"><strong>Lore Team Direction</strong></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>General guiding principle moving forward:</p>
<p>| “Don’t talk about gameplay in lore.”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This isn’t a hard rule, but a reminder that specific gameplay mechanics like exact percentages, stats, or balance implications should not be detailed in lore discussions. Lore can and should reference gameplay in broad strokes, but the exact implementation details are better left to cross team or systems wide conversations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the lore team wants to explore a concept that heavily involves gameplay design or mechanics, those conversations should be initiated in the contributor-ideas forum, where members from all relevant teams can contribute. This helps ensure alignment across lore, design, and development without restricting creativity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="processes--structure"><a class="header" href="#processes--structure"><strong>Processes &amp; Structure</strong></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We are working toward clear processes for:</p>
<ul>
<li>How people join or move into all project roles (Contributor, Coordinator, PM, Director, etc.)</li>
<li>How decisions are made with community developed processes that go to a vote before implementation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated drafts of roles and responsibilities for PMs, Coordinators, and Directors will be published for community feedback and approval.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="transparency--communication"><a class="header" href="#transparency--communication"><strong>Transparency &amp; Communication</strong></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PM and Coordinator meetings (like this one) will be summarized and shared regularly with the broader community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Posted to mdBooks, in consideration how this would be communicated regularly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We aim to keep all contributors informed and involved in key project discussions and updates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="server-discussion"><a class="header" href="#server-discussion"><strong>Server Discussion</strong></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing conversation about moving WotR development to a dedicated Discord server.
<ul>
<li>This would help clarify project identity while still maintaining ties to the Wolds community.</li>
<li>If pursued, the move would be announced well in advance, with a transition period and checks to ensure all team members are moved successfully.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Development Flow:
Fork the repo - &gt; Make changes on local repo -&gt; Make a merge request -&gt; Reviewers approve/deny request -&gt; Approved changes get merged into repo</p>
<p>Reviewers</p>

<li>Addon developers could be good options</li>
<li>Limit usage of NBT data (Don't go overboard) -Xverion</li>
</ul>
<p>Any developers that have interest in loot and ability system they can start on that. While abilities are not necessary for MVP they are simple and can be a good start for developers. Make simple loot for the time being. We could use the vanilla loot tables.</p>
<p>New Forum for Feature Development</p>
<ul>
<li>These forums are only meant to be used for active development, not a place for general discussion.</li>
</ul>
